Richard has done an amazing job setting up the gallery and I would highly recommend anyone in the area go see it (and hopefully buy something!).<br /><br />After saying hello, we went over to Easdale's slaty beach to capture some coastal rays and to browse around for shots. My Dad and I kept finding square and triangular holes in the slate and spent some time trying to work out where they had come from (triangular worms??) and eventually we found out that the slate was embedded with iron pyrites! As we wandered around the beach we found large swathes of coastal slate studded with protruding fools good. Obviously this couldn't go without an attempt at a photograph. <br /><br />I knew the bright blue sky would cast an intense blue onto the transparency and left the shot unfiltered. The setup was a little hairy (dangling in approaching water, see picture) but eventually I fired off a couple of shots and we drove back to Glencoe as the weather was closing in..<br /><br />Here's the picture and a shot of me taking it (taken with my iPhone to record time and date and gps position)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQ3v4m-GcNI/AAAAAAAAAqI/meSWFDd21co/s1600-h/2954295351_133d3e0ee3_b.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 254px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQ3v4m-GcNI/AAAAAAAAAqI/meSWFDd21co/s320/2954295351_133d3e0ee3_b.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264127295278706898" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQ3v49awF6I/AAAAAAAAAqQ/F5mIEodcufc/s1600-h/IMG_00761.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQ3v49awF6I/AAAAAAAAAqQ/F5mIEodcufc/s320/IMG_00761.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5264127301304457122" /></a>

We know the location from a thousand photographs and we're hoping to see something new that will say something different about the location. And if any location epitomises this, Lochan Na h'Achlaise must be up near the top of the list. The classic shot is of that certain tree, typically shot with the Black Mount in the background and with the reflected sunrise and morning mists.. I was hoping to make something more of some of these different aspects, especially the mist, colour of light and the rocks exposed because of the shallow water. I'd convinced my Dad to come with me (despite many complaints about the early hour) and I was hoping he would see some of the amazing sights I think a lot of us have experienced there.. <br /><br />So, we're up in the early hours and I take my dad over to the obvious location to take some shots and whilst he is shooting away, I start to find a composition out of the group of rocks at the foot of 'that tree'. The technical setup is really simple with my 240 Fujinon A; f/16 for 1s and a few degrees of back tilt. <br /><br />One of things about Lochan Na h'Achlaise is that there is a particular pattern to the light and mist (at least every time I've been there). Firstly, the mist is in clumps, clinging to the islands before the sun rises. At this time the water is incredibly still. As the sun begins to rise, the mist moves around a little, still with totally clear sections here and there. After a while the movement starts to create texture on the water. Very soon after this the mist starts to spread and that is the end of the totally clear sections. From now on the mist spreads out and thins and the colour of the light declines. Minutes later and the sun rises and starts to warm the land, the mist rises a lot and there is no chance of really great photos. This mist is then around for the next 20-30 mins and will only clear once the sun comes up. What you have is a window of opportunity of about 15 mins before and 15 minutes after sunrise where the air is still, the mist is playing niceley and the colour is at a peak. Most people arrive at the lochan just after this.<br /><br />So I knew I only had a few moments to get another shot and the tree was looking so inviting and from the angle I was at, I could see the islands behind the tree being hidden in the mist. Soo... I said what the hell. I'll take a go at it.. On goes the my Nikkor 360 T-ED and f/32 for a second .. The results are embarrasingly good (not as in it's amazing but that I'd like to show it off but it is that tree! ah well, I'm sure I can cope). So .. here it is.. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQoq1d58YsI/AAAAAAAAApQ/AQ4CfdB8Wvs/s1600-h/2934354615_27b4258303_b.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 400px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQoq1d58YsI/AAAAAAAAApQ/AQ4CfdB8Wvs/s400/2934354615_27b4258303_b.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5263066212584940226" /></a><br /><br />and a couple of pictures of my camera taking these :-)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQrlXzWc6VI/AAAAAAAAAp4/Q9BV6fK8Gis/s1600-h/IMG_00741.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQrlXzWc6VI/AAAAAAAAAp4/Q9BV6fK8Gis/s320/IMG_00741.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5263271311619975506" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQrlXTiSzaI/AAAAAAAAApw/Vlq6tSfyJwo/s1600-h/IMG_00721.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQrlXTiSzaI/AAAAAAAAApw/Vlq6tSfyJwo/s320/IMG_00721.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5263271303079710114" /></a>

We headed up to Glen Nevis in what must be the worst weather for photography. Blazing hot sunshine without a cloud in the sky! Well this is a 'holiday' despite my obsession with photography and so I settled back and enjoyed the hike up the chasm into Glen Nevis, what has to be one of the most wondrous hanging vallys in the UK . My dad has rediscovered his enjoyment of photography recently and we pottered around taking pictures here and there with our digital appendages but it was way too bright even in the shadows.. <br /><br />As we got to the top of the valley, we found an amazing amount of quartz in the granite which had been scoured by glaciers and polished. One particular block of quartzite followed a line that was continued by the river down to the end of the valley and, despite the light, I had to try to make some sort of photograph. If anything, it was a good opportunity to try out Pro 160 negative film. So I took the picture above with digital and I'm still in the process of processing the results from the Pro160. I don't think shot can ever look great but it's definitely a composition I will be coming back to.<br /><br />The shot was taken on my 80mm Schneider SSXL at f/32 and needed a compound tilt to get the focus along the rock correct. The first film I've got back was taken rated at 100 iso and the highlights on the rock are burnt out slightly.. I did take another couple of 160's so I'm pulling these slightly to see what the results are like.. I also took a provia exposed for the grass to try to get a colour reference.. I'll post again once I get these back and have a chance to post process.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQog9WJpwyI/AAAAAAAAAo4/9zPrdQkdcP0/s1600-h/IMG_7814-small.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQog9WJpwyI/AAAAAAAAAo4/9zPrdQkdcP0/s400/IMG_7814-small.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5263055352826020642" /></a>

The reason for this was a mixture of being a lot happier taking photographs in any conditions, being prepared for those conditions (thank you Paramo!) and being willing to stay out all day under all but the most persistent downpours (we were meant to spend a day out with Richard Childs but it rained in torrents for two hours, after which we retired to the cabin for coffee and watched the rain out of the window). I should say that even thought most days had rain, all but one of the rainy days was interspersed with sunshine to good effect.<br /><br />The thing about having 'difficult' weather for photography is that I had to concentrate more on the composition more than just pointing at some nice light. Some of the pictures I thought were good will suffer from not having "luminous light" but for me the acheivement is about how well I coped with what was given. I'd like to think I did OK in most cases and in a couple of cases I'm really happy. <br /><br />I'm going to be posting a 'daily summary' (much like my last Scottish holiday) with a few notes on what my thoughts turned to on each day..  <br /><br />So, how was the first day? Well Charlotte and I got up earlyish and went over to the famous Lochan Na h'Achlaise with the goal of having a good wander around. In the end we did a lot more than that, we ended up circumnavigating the shoreline of the lochan and wandering around a few tributaries. There were lots of interesting places but the by the time we got to them, the light was unflattering. Toward the start of the hike though, I saw that the sunlight and the white clouds were creating a diffuse highlight on the lakes surface and the ripples were bouncing off the rocks to create rings. After wandering up and down the shore for a few minutes, I found a suitable composition that made a feature of this (not a too strong one however) and that receded toward the horizon in nice curves, The picture was intended as black and white but I wasn't confident that it would be good and hence did not take a large format shot. Now that I've seen the results, I wish I had.. This has convinced me that I need to learn to see better in black and white and possibly to buy a couple of black and white filters (I ended up using a yellow filter on this shot but only in Potatoshop). The result is a subtle shot but one that I find quite pleasing and reflects the morning very well.. <br /><br />Just for future reference, at the north or northwest end of the lochan there are many tree stumps that are slowly being exposed out of the peat. I intend to return to these next time I'm up in Glencoe. I've added a 'refererence (i.e. crap) shot to show an area at the west north west corner... <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQoJVO5BoaI/AAAAAAAAAoo/NSx0m3BfMQM/s1600-h/IMG_77431.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 335px; height: 400px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SQoJVO5BoaI/AAAAAAAAAoo/NSx0m3BfMQM/s400/IMG_77431.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5263029374915027362" /></a><br /><br />I was a little disspointed in the day's outing in some ways.. I was hoping for some 'amazing' light in the morning which didn't occur and I was looking for a great composition which maybe occured(?) but really I think I was trying too hard to see; I wanted to get 'into the zone' too much. In the end we went home (after emptying boots of water) and met up with my parents who were staying for the first few days of our holiday, hoping that the next day would help my head to get back in the right shape.

I feel as if I've wasted these months without getting anything of interest. It hasn't been that I've failed to go out, it's more that the opportunities to go out have tended to be during the middle of the day on sunny days; never a good situation for great photography in the first place, but I've also typically been in company when the opportunity to linger hasn't been availble. The times I have been out have produced some pictures that I like, particularly the Yorkshire Swampland shot (which is a bit of a work in progress - more to come soon I hope). <br /><br />I did manage to get a last couple of trips in over the last week, one to Northumberland to see some of my wifes family and Charlotte and I went to the Valley of Desolation this Sunday morning at 6am. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SLukV76DVKI/AAAAAAAAAn0/Q8EH_pOyexM/s1600-h/IMG_7659-Edit-Edit1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SLukV76DVKI/AAAAAAAAAn0/Q8EH_pOyexM/s400/IMG_7659-Edit-Edit1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240963288141092002" /></a><br /><br />The Northumbeland trip was more of an introduction to the location by David and Elaine who live in Sunderaland and who made us feel very welcome. They took us up to Craster to see Dunstanborough castle, where I shot a picture of the keep - royaly screwing up two sheets of film in a 'shorten the exposure length to compensate for ND filters' fiasco, and to the pier in Sunderland where I shot a quick DSLR picture in homage to Melanie Foster. A quick aside, Melanie has an exhibition at Richard Child's gallery in October called "Inspired by Nature's Light".<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SLukVzMSyLI/AAAAAAAAAn8/84fc-RsidQ0/s1600-h/IMG_7655-Edit1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SLukVzMSyLI/AAAAAAAAAn8/84fc-RsidQ0/s400/IMG_7655-Edit1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240963285801683122" /></a><br /><br />This weekend Charlotte and I went to the "Valley of Desolation" which , despite it's name, is quite beautiful. The morning brought a long lasting mist over the whole of the North that stayed around all day but which was very good for shooting detail shots and also for making Yorkshire look like a New Zealand swamp. Perhaps I've got a new project on "How to make Yorkshire look like anywhere in the world" :-)<br /><br />Taking the first shot for this post made me realise how difficult it sometimes is to be 'creative' with the balance of light in a picture. I've spent the last year learning how to control the light in a picture with grads and centre filters and shift or rise/fall but I haven't really thought about when 'not' to do this compensation or when to use these techniques to creatively increase the contrast range in a shot. Although the example of the Valley of Desolation shot has come out well, I do feel that I could have let the top of the picture lighten up to create a more shadowy foreground. I suppose this is about 'pre-visualisation' of the desired contrasts within a picture and these thoughts should come naturally but, like most things in life, I end up thinking too much about them. I shall have to add to my 'checklist' to think about the overall large scale contrast within a picture and what I can do to control/enhance it.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SLun90bdfJI/AAAAAAAAAoM/qXcH7Pm4ZLE/s1600-h/IMG_7708-Edit1-2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SLun90bdfJI/AAAAAAAAAoM/qXcH7Pm4ZLE/s400/IMG_7708-Edit1-2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240967271863385234" /></a><br /><br />Why am I moaning so much..? well it's really born out of excitement of what is to come rather than dissapointment with what has passed.. It hasn't really been that bad of a summer rather I haven't made enough effort to just 'get out and do it'. <br /><br />The next couple of months should be a little different however. Light and Land's Discovery Day is next weekened where I'm hoping to catch up with a few acquaintencies and to listen to some, hopefully inspiring, talks. Our holiday in Scotland is coming up too where we'll be spending two weeks in Glencoe where I'm hoping to meet up with Richard Childs (please try and get to see Richard's gallery in Oban if you can!!)

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SKs0Vf0WJII/AAAAAAAAAnk/WfQVLvk6r04/s1600-h/whitelichen.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SKs0Vf0WJII/AAAAAAAAAnk/WfQVLvk6r04/s400/whitelichen.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5236336535671284866" /></a><br /><br />I've posted previously about a comparison between drum scanners and Epson flatbeds. The fact that the drum scanner trounced the Epson was not really in contention but recently I had the opportunity to get a scan from a modern Imacon scanner (owned by Joe Cornish) and from a Howtek 4000 drum scanner (re-badged Crosfield Magnascan 200i I believe, and owned by Dav Thomas) using Silverfast Ai v 6.6 & Kami SXL 2001 fluid both using the same transparency that I had previously had problems with using my Epson. <br /><br />I knew that the drum scanner was going to provide a better resolution scan than the Imacon but I was more interested in how well it scanned shadows and was it immune to some of the artefacts that I'd seen from the Imacon and the Epson. These artefacts were halation and chromatic abberation. <br /><br />Halation, a glow around high brightness areas that impinges into darker areas. I have seen a small version of this, a few pixels on a 2000dpi scan, and also a larger version that spreads 2-300 pixels. In photographic terms this is similar to flare and I imagine it occurs in a similar fashion. In the example scan you can see this in the area around the cliff edge and also at the top of the worms head island.<br /><br /><a href="http://timparkin.co.uk/static/scanner_comparison_1/index.psp?code=wormshead">Interactive Example of Halation</a><br /><br />Chromatic abberation is evinced as a red and blue borders at opposite sides of a high contrast edge. In the scan you can see this the worst around the white lichen hot spots at the bottom left of the picture but it can also be seen at the top right of the cliff top and also as a strange colouring in the sea where you have a highlight off the wave top right next to a shadow from that same wave. The image at the top of this post shows one of an example of this.<br /><br /><a href="http://timparkin.co.uk/static/scanner_comparison_1/index.psp?code=whitelichen">Interactive example of Chromatic Abberation</a><br /><br />In comparing these results, it should be kept in mind that the drum scan took 5 mins of mounting and 1.5 hours of scanning wheras the Imacon took 5 minutes to do both.<br /><br />Here is one of the clearer examples which shows what happens if you want to pull detail out of shadow areas..<br /><br /><a href="http://timparkin.co.uk/static/scanner_comparison_1/index.psp?code=shadowssharpened">Interactive Example of pulling shadow detail - look closeley at the twig bottom left</a><br /><br />Click on the many links on the left hand side of the Interactive Example to see more crops.<br /><br />In conclusion it seems that the best way to scan images is to get a drum scanner. However, there are many other factors at play here. Wet scanning is messy and a lot of people are uncomfortable exposing transparencies in this way. Also, the whole process is a lot more time consuming. Finally, the amount of room a drum scanner takes up can be 10x as much as an Imacon. Realistically, if you want to scan more than a couple of photos a month and you have the budget, an Imacon will always be a better choice. However, for those with limited budgets, excess time and who only process a few images a month, a drum scanner will produce stunning results.

I haven't been out a great deal recently but I did get to visit a local reservoir with another local photographer, Jason Theaker. The weather looked decent and so after a short walk spent discussing the positive and negative sides of entering photography competitions (and the vagaries of the first round selection), we arrived at the banks of Lindley Wood Reservoir where we played around at the edges where birch and oak trees threw branches down into the water. The main photograph is one taken with my digital camera (I still haven't had any large format developed for about two months - I must think I've got a right load of crap to wait this long). I quite like the result in that it transforms what is possibly an unappealling location into something a little magical. The quality of the light on the water needs to be seen at a higher resolution to appreciate.<br /><br />So.. I'm spending far too much time working on websites and far to little time outside. The weather isn't doing me any favours either, I bought a couple of cloud spotting books recently to try to understand why it's so bloody awful (occluded fronts suck for photography is one of my observations). A very good visual resource can be found <a href="http://www.free-online-private-pilot-ground-school.com/Aviation-Weather-Principles.html">here</a>. From what I've read, the area in front of a warm fronts should be quite interesting for photography.<br /><br />I've also been to see the Ansel Adams exhibition in Walsall and I have to say that despite the some of the prints being amazing, the exhibition in general was a bit of a let down. There is very little extra information and the pictures are not displayed in the best of conditions (although it is in a light room which makes viewing OK). What struck me was the balance of the images. They are not 'in your face' (although moonrise might fit in that category) and carry the subject matter with a subtlety that surprised me. Overall I was very happy to have gone but disspointed that the curators could not have made a lot more of it. <br /><br />Another aside about the Ansel Adams exhibition is the choice of pictures. Supposedly these were the pictures that Ansel himself wanted to display to best represent his love of photography. What we have is a little bit of a mish mash of great pictures with (in my opinion) slightly dull shots of buildings and people. Of course, this is the clash between what we like in our own images and what other people like. I think that these differences contribute more to what we think of as 'style' than anything overt. If we are picking compositions out from a landscape, we will obviously choose things that we like and hence, if our tastes are consistent (which isn't a given) then what we like contributes greatly to our 'style'. This conclusion also serves to emphasise the need for us to be good and consistent critics of our own pictures (for example, if we change our mind about a picture because everyone else likes it then we will obviously be absorbing other people's styles).<br /><br />I was discussing these themes with Mr Ward recently and I think we are both of the opinion that if two people like or dislike the same thing about a particular photograph then it probably says more about the two people than it does the photograph (my words, not David's). <br /><br />Anyway - back to website building and flip flopping between dismissing competitions as a ludicrous idea (as a self preservationist anticipatory response to not winning) and thinking competitions could be a great way of gaining exposure (as long as I win). Why I do this to myself? It's the balance between self and ego that makes showing pictures to other people so addictive and yet so disturbing. <br /><br />Bye for now - Oh.. and next post I'm going to be comparing scans from a Drum Scanner (my friend Dav Thomas has recently bought one for &#163;250) an Imacon (Joe Cornish's) and an Epson v750 (mine). The results are very interesting...

It wasn't that there was a lack of subject matter; The place we went to, Warrendale Knotts, was extraordinary and put Malham to shame in some ways but there didn't seem to be an 'idea' out there... <br /><br />The three photographs I came away with (first one with the Ebony but not developed yet) were OK and portrayed what was around me but they didn't have a visual story (for want of a better phrase) to lead me into the picture. I started to think why I thought like this, why did I think something was missing.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of is that I didn't see either a strong actual subject or a strong compositional subject. These two things are what excite me when I find them in the field. The actual subject would be something like a tree or an erratic boulder or a waterfall, etc. The compositional subject would be a strong suggested shape or interlocking of shapes or a pattern that repeats in a geometric fashion. My favourite photographs combine these two things together, for instance my recent shot of the English Stonecrop where the composition shape was a flow across the frame and back, using a visual metaphor for a waterfall. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SIUNSZqgP_I/AAAAAAAAAm0/90YmMf7ATGs/s1600-h/IMG_7518-Edit1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SIUNSZqgP_I/AAAAAAAAAm0/90YmMf7ATGs/s400/IMG_7518-Edit1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5225597552411295730" /></a><br /><br />With the location I was in at the weekend, there was no actual subjects that were enough of a focal point to support a picture on its own. The rocks formations were nice but there wasn't a main attraction and a supporting cast (e.g. Old Man of Storr or the Quiraing) so the strength of the actual subject wasn't that great. It was also difficult to combine the elements into a strong geometric/compositional arrangement. This left me with trying to balance weak subject matter with subtle arrangement to create a coherent whole. Now I know this can be done as Christopher Burkett and Eliot Porter or masters at this, but I have difficulty visualising these types of composition in the field. <br /><br />At the moment I'm using my 5D as a finder still and walking all around an area (in this case the crags that appear in all three shots) trying to find suitable arrangements. I'll then take my compact flash back to Charlotte (who has either fallen asleep at this stage or is happily reading a book) and look through the pictures to choose a 'best'. So in this case I chose the second picture as the one I would take with the large format camera. <br /><br />When I returned, however, I thought that the second picture here is probably the better composition. I didn't think it would work as well whilst looking through the finder because of the scree in the left hand corner of the picture. Now I'm not so sure, I quite like the 'more complete' view but feel the first picture has more compositional interest .  feedback welcome!. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SIUNSjTppQI/AAAAAAAAAm8/n2Ze88MLwxk/s1600-h/IMG_7552-Edit1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SIUNSjTppQI/AAAAAAAAAm8/n2Ze88MLwxk/s400/IMG_7552-Edit1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5225597554999796994" /></a><br /><br />And finally, just to take up a point that David mentioned in his recent heretical support of the digital phone camera, I took this shot whilst walking back where the light literally appeared out of nowhere and was gone in a minute. The picture isn't great (Thistles are difficult plant in many ways) but it was visual feast at the time. <br /><br />I'm trying my best to work out 'field tactics' for finding compositions and the main thing at the moment appears to be about finding a base camp and then scouting around with just my SLR, feeling free to photograph those things that interest me. This does mean carrying around far too much gear though, perhaps once I get a mini GND kit for my Ricoh I'll try to sacrifice the 5D.. The problem I have with the Ricoh though is that using the zoom becomes too much of a concious decision. With the 5D, I look through the viewfinder (I've cropped it to 4x5 btw) and with my right hand on the zoom , I can wander around a composition whilst dynamically changing the focal length, playing with perspective as part of my experimenting. With the Ricoh, the feedback loop between thinking about zooming in and it actually happening is just too slow to stay in the sub-concious. <br /><br />I have looked around for 1.6 crop factor SLR/Lens combination that would be a lot lighter than the 5D but there aren't many lenses that do the same as the 24-105 (I'd need a 16-65 lens at least.. preferably a 12-80 to get a decent range..).<br /><br />Actualy I've just this second had a browse around and discovered what may be the perfect compromise.. Sony have a 16-105 lens for their 1.5 crop factor cameras. This is 96-630mm equiv in large format terms.. Hmmm... more thinking needed.

I have been out a couple of times though, the first with a photographer whose work I very much admire, <a href="http://www.jonbrockphotography.com/gallery_156913.html">Jon Brock</a>, and also out with Charlotte to Saltwick Bay. <br /><br />Jon and I went to Twistleton to wander around the same location that myself and Nigel Halliwell covered a month or so back. We took a different route around though and went slightly further into the Keld Head Scar area. There is a lot of potential around here but this time I couldn't find anything that jumped out at me. I was using my 5D and the Epson viewer to assess the 'note' pictures I had taken and there is definitely some mileage to be had with this idea. The 4" screen on the Epson is just enough to allow an assessment of colour and texture where the screen on the Ricoh or 5D are not quite enough. I did take one picture but haven't sent it off to be developed yet.<br /><br />The following are two pictures from that day, the first from my Ricoh and the second from the 5D.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SHf1_VMLCGI/AAAAAAAAAmk/H3CaJ7z1ZG0/s1600-h/Untitled-1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SHf1_VMLCGI/AAAAAAAAAmk/H3CaJ7z1ZG0/s400/Untitled-1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5221912761328142434" /></a><br /><br /><br />Jon was a very nice guy and I enjoyed working on location with him. We had similar ideas about when to stop, when to work an area hard and when to move on to a new area. It was good to discuss ideas and the potential of features depending on weather and the time of year. We both agreed that this area could be very nice for winter sunsets as the sun, which descends behind the end of Leck Fell, will shine down the valley to highlight the edges of the scar and Twistleton opposite.<br /><br />The second outing was with Charlotte last weekend where we both committed to going out for a walk at Saltwick and despite the storm and flood warnings we still went. I can't say it was the most productive day (apart from the fact it tested out my new Paramo coat which passed with flying colours - it's the Pajaro but mine is a secret grey version, just so i'm not mistaken for a twitcher). I did find some nice pier posts and took a quick photo of the red stones at the start of the slate bed at the nab end. Driving back we saw the most amazing 'eye of the hurricaine' effect over Hole of Hocum. Bright sunshine over a 5 mile area surrounded by black sheer clouds and lightning - unfortunately there was no real possibility of photographic location (and Charlotte was asleep in the passenger seat).

We met up to have a chat about online photo communities for a secret project and also just to generally have the normal gossip that photographers have when they get together. Except it wasn't the normal chat that photographers have; we ended up talking a lot more philosophy and creativity than cameras and software. Fortunately we weren't too far apart in outlook otherwise the 5 hours we spent talking would have been a lot less enjoyable. Whilst walking around we passed a wonderful field full of grasses and mulberries that I then returned to with Charlotte one evening. I haven't taken any 'proper' pictures of it yet but the textures and tones suggest that there must be something in there..<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SHPO9Z0OwFI/AAAAAAAAAmU/l4q3z41_Cvw/s1600-h/IMG_73821.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SHPO9Z0OwFI/AAAAAAAAAmU/l4q3z41_Cvw/s400/IMG_73821.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5220743947349835858" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SHPO93ydMDI/AAAAAAAAAmc/U6RORIOZSDo/s1600-h/IMG_74191.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SHPO93ydMDI/AAAAAAAAAmc/U6RORIOZSDo/s400/IMG_74191.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5220743955395457074" /></a>

I experimented a fair bit with Pro160 (example below) and took more pictures in bright light than I would have.. I even took some pansy-girly flower shots! :-)<br /><br />The shot at the top is the one I thought would come out best and is one of my favourites. The colours have come out a lot nicer than the digital shot (and obviously the detail is immense). I have captured an ant posing somewhere in the shot though - see below.. :-)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SGFZV_oBx9I/AAAAAAAAAko/8Ll7cY2OYhI/s1600-h/0.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SGFZV_oBx9I/AAAAAAAAAko/8Ll7cY2OYhI/s400/0.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5215548077863192530" /></a><br /><br /><br />The other shots I quite liked are below. The sunset and dusk shots of the Valerian work and prove again how resistant large format lenses are to lens flare (i've followed the first one up with an SLR equivalent). I'm quite proud of the Strangles shot.. I was after a brutal, harsh shot and was purposely working with small depth of field to create a little more tension.. The place I was standing must have only been created in the last few weeks as the rock was so clean it couldn't even have been rained on. The salt rime was also very recent. I didn't stay around too long.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SGFZWLhIJuI/AAAAAAAAAkw/dj2XsErH7LY/s1600-h/2601482211_182fcf528f_b.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SGFZWLhIJuI/AAAAAAAAAkw/dj2XsErH7LY/s400/2601482211_182fcf528f_b.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5215548081055475426" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SGFdG__606I/AAAAAAAAAlo/lZBh1C4oRRg/s1600-h/IMG_70271.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SGFdG__606I/AAAAAAAAAlo/lZBh1C4oRRg/s400/IMG_70271.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5215552218311873442" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SGFZWtv2g9I/AAAAAAAAAk4/5DyA4VbISSQ/s1600-h/2602310388_c7f3e4e439_b.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SGFZWtv2g9I/AAAAAAAAAk4/5DyA4VbISSQ/s400/2602310388_c7f3e4e439_b.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5215548090244039634" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SGFZWi30B1I/AAAAAAAAAlA/SbK8ISki1xM/s1600-h/2603101991_ef245988f9_b.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SGFZWi30B1I/AAAAAAAAAlA/SbK8ISki1xM/s400/2603101991_ef245988f9_b.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5215548087324641106" /></a><br /><br />My final shot is a work in progress of the magenta and turqoise stripes on the stretch of coast between Rock and Polzeath called Greenaway.

However, it fulfils my OCD quota for the week so here goes. <br /><br />Firstly, here is a piccie of the inside of my camera bag for reference.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFlfzqxEhEI/AAAAAAAAAj4/eaEvF_niSJw/s1600-h/IMG_73041.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFlfzqxEhEI/AAAAAAAAAj4/eaEvF_niSJw/s400/IMG_73041.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213303384916132930" /></a><br /><br />And here are the bits taken out so you can see them.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFlfz4xQd9I/AAAAAAAAAkA/Ib2plWj4iDA/s1600-h/IMG_73061.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFlfz4xQd9I/AAAAAAAAAkA/Ib2plWj4iDA/s400/IMG_73061.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213303388675012562" /></a><br /><br />I've only recenty reorganised everything to try to make it easily accesible. The interesting bits that I've recently been playing with are the new lens caps and filter holders, both inspired by Joe Cornish.<br /><br />Firstly, the lens caps are probably fairly obvious in the pictures. They are actually Green and Blacks ice cream lids with Gaffer tape added to provide a push fit which will exclude dust. The labels are from a CD label kit I never used.. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFljoeebG9I/AAAAAAAAAkI/L-0SafWI7n8/s1600-h/IMG_73241.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFljoeebG9I/AAAAAAAAAkI/L-0SafWI7n8/s400/IMG_73241.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213307590684646354" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFljozqXgHI/AAAAAAAAAkQ/p6VhcUoDjsE/s1600-h/IMG_73251.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFljozqXgHI/AAAAAAAAAkQ/p6VhcUoDjsE/s400/IMG_73251.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213307596371886194" /></a><br /><br />The key to getting a flush fit on the Lee adapters is to long strips of gaffer tape that can fit inside the lid which are added before the flaps you can see. These strips are stuck to the inside edge of the lid and are added to close the diameter of the lid slightly. I added four layers of gaffer tape and then added a final strip of gaffer tape on the outside that was then folded onto the inside (with judicious strips cut to stop creasing). <br /><br />The other custom addition is my hacked lee filter kits. I took a razor to my Lee 10 filter holders and ended up with four thin books with five sleeves each. These now take up about half of the space and I can find and replace filters a lot faster. The finding bit is easier because of the clever sewing machine acrobatics courtesy of my wife Charlotte's wizzy sewing machine. This allowed me to stitch on the names of each filter which makes flipping through all of the filters a snip.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFllSoMEutI/AAAAAAAAAkY/X2ORPu_SLGM/s1600-h/IMG_73071.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFllSoMEutI/AAAAAAAAAkY/X2ORPu_SLGM/s400/IMG_73071.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213309414358170322" /></a>

Blue skys all day do wonders for your mood but don't really help much in getting attractive photographs. The picture at the top of this post was taken on a really sunny day at the Strangles but whilst hiding under an umbrella (a borrowed one that was white and black big checks - my current one is black and red and lends a ghastly cast if used as a shade). The plant is English Stonecrop and is only one of many plants that are incredibly bountiful and lush at the moment. Other plants that were particularly remarkable were the Kidney Vetches (in reds, oranges and yellows), various orchids and orchid like plants, Thrift (although most of it was cooked) and many types of Speedwell. I'm not normally a 'flower' person but this holiday was the first time I really looked at the way the plant life and landscape interact and enhance one another and accepted that, just because they are a stereotypical subject matter, it doesn't mean that flowers can't be used as an ingredient in a successful composition. <br /><br />We were staying in Rock (again) and spent most of our time walking around the dunes and over to The Greenaway (between Rock and Polzeath) but we also visited Pentire Head, Lundy Hole, Booby Bay and the Strangles. The Strangles was definitely the highlight with new rockfalls calving pristine geological features. The bright sunshine didn't help though and I'm not sure I've got the best results, we'll have to wait to see what the film comes back like.<br /><br />I did try out some polaroid though, I figured there wasn't much to lose in seeing what could be extracted from it. The results were useful in checking to see whether shots were compositionally OK (I think my new screen should help with this also) and they were a lot freindlier to use in hot sunshine where they 'set' much faster (so little smearing, running, condensation staining, etc).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFjule5590I/AAAAAAAAAiQ/oJ5aTuGcaKg/s1600-h/polaroid1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFjule5590I/AAAAAAAAAiQ/oJ5aTuGcaKg/s400/polaroid1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213178896399857474" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFjulrCr6CI/AAAAAAAAAiY/Nb_EJYSOUsY/s1600-h/polaroid2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFjulrCr6CI/AAAAAAAAAiY/Nb_EJYSOUsY/s400/polaroid2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213178899657910306" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFjul9uxK7I/AAAAAAAAAig/saC0MNRn8fE/s1600-h/polaroid3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFjul9uxK7I/AAAAAAAAAig/saC0MNRn8fE/s400/polaroid3.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213178904674642866" /></a><br /><br /><br />I'm happy with a couple of these, probably the one with the most potential is the Foxglove one taken at Pentire Head. We'll see when the transparencies come back.<br /><br />What became apparent on the holiday is that I need to concentrate more on finding the shot - I have a bad habit of premature commital, which means I'll get <em>a</em> but not <em>the</em> shot. I also so want to return to the same locations to extract more out of them. I'm considering closing the feedback loop a little better by taking a small laptop with me when I'm on short hikes - that way I can take digital shots, find the composition I want, see what is wrong with it and then return immediatly to correct it. This isn't something I want to do on a regular basis but the LCD on my 5D just isn't good enough to adequatly assess the pictures I'm taking. I do have an Epson p5000 which I was thinking about selling. I might try this instead as it's a lot smaller and it has a bright screen. What I'm getting at is that I possibly need to spend more time fine tuning composition before committing to the picture - I'm too wrapped up in the process of taking still to be able to release my mind enough to constantly consider composition. <br /><br />[I've just been re-reading this and it's not quite clear what I meant. To summarise - I see an object or feature when looking for a composition. My mind then fixes on this object and tries to work out how to create a composition from it. The problem is that I'm now locked into using this object in my composition and I'm closed to any other opportunities. The problem is that there may be no suitable composition that works, even though the object itself is really interesting]<br /><br />Finally, here are a couple more shots taken with the digital camera that were 'interesting' to me. The long exposure daylight shot was with a .9 and a .6 acrylic lee ND and also the dark end of a 1.2 Singh Ray hard grad ND. The strange colours are a result of the grads not blocking infra red and causing a colour cast across the red end of the spectrum (and also possibly a bit of the green). I've taken a picture using this combination and film so it should be interesting to see the difference.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFj0a3iUmbI/AAAAAAAAAi4/p2-Gs4z5YT8/s1600-h/IMG_69951.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFj0a3iUmbI/AAAAAAAAAi4/p2-Gs4z5YT8/s400/IMG_69951.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213185311103031730" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFj0bOrvmnI/AAAAAAAAAjA/j0SnyaScpeY/s1600-h/IMG_70621.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFj0bOrvmnI/AAAAAAAAAjA/j0SnyaScpeY/s400/IMG_70621.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213185317316565618" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFj0bf2-23I/AAAAAAAAAjI/hecOE_8pjuA/s1600-h/IMG_72181.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFj0bf2-23I/AAAAAAAAAjI/hecOE_8pjuA/s400/IMG_72181.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213185321927105394" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFj0bUOERoI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/Z-u5l7CXcoU/s1600-h/IMG_72281.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFj0bUOERoI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/Z-u5l7CXcoU/s400/IMG_72281.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5213185318802704002" /></a>

Firstly, it may help to know what a fresnel is. The image above should help a little with this. <br /><br />A fresnel is a normal lens but cut into lots of donut shapes and squished flat. A well designed fresnel should behave almost exactly the same as the equivalent lens. So what is a fresnel used for .. Well the main use is in helping view wide angle lenses where if you only have a ground screen you will tend to get a 'hot spot' in the centre and dark corners. A fresnel can focus the light back into your eye as shown below.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFg5CO75r1I/AAAAAAAAAhs/Z1bWq0Iq2xM/s1600-h/Untitled-1.gif"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFg5CO75r1I/AAAAAAAAAhs/Z1bWq0Iq2xM/s400/Untitled-1.gif" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5212979279213211474" /></a><br /><br />The standard fresnel with the Ebony is satisfactory but I got spoilt by seeing the Maxwell screen that Joe Cornish is using which has the added advantage of having no markings on it whatsoever (although I might need to add tilt markings for the assymetric tilt). The Ebony fresnel also has a distinct central circle where there is no fresnel cuts which shows as an obvious mark on the screen. The image below shows real photograph of both fresnels.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFhFj0U2FAI/AAAAAAAAAh4/shxRdFhIm5g/s1600-h/fresnel-ebony.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFhFj0U2FAI/AAAAAAAAAh4/shxRdFhIm5g/s400/fresnel-ebony.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5212993050325160962" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFhFl1dAR6I/AAAAAAAAAiA/epAp0JYKBIQ/s1600-h/fresnel-maxwell.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFhFl1dAR6I/AAAAAAAAAiA/epAp0JYKBIQ/s400/fresnel-maxwell.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5212993084987557794" /></a> <br /><br />I'm extremely happy with the Maxwell screen which, although it costs nearly &#163;200, enhances every lens I own. The big surprise is what a difference it makes to the 80mm Schneider Super Symmar XL. I had to check that I hadn't put the 110 on by mistake it's that even and bright. I also checked it with the 360 and 500 to see if I would get dark corners (with longer lenses the fresnel can 'over focus' which means you end up with a hot spot but for a different reason - this can look really peculiar) but there was no problem at all. The only lens that was slightly worse for field of view was the 240 but not in any significant way (and I think this may be just me being picky). <br /><br />I have a feeling that the difference between the two fresnels is that the Maxwell is probably made to a lesser precision and hence suffers from blurring and abberations. With the Maxwell screen, the lines that are prominent on the Ebony are very thin and the image between the faint lines is a lot crisper. This makes focussing lenses easier, and in the case of the 80SSXL, a LOT easier. I suppose it's only like any other lens construction, the better made - the better the image.<br /><br />The big test is how it affects my composition. I'm hoping that the lack of lines in the frame will let me concentrate on the composition as a whole and that the even-nes of illumination will also let me see the whole picture at once in a much clearer way.

However, we chickened each other into going out anyway and despite me getting lost we ended up driving around the back of Malham Tarn to a place called Winskill Stones. <br /><br />Winskill is somewhere I'd never even heard of but it has a wondrous backdrop, s small limestone pavement and some amazing stone wallage, The following images are Dav's (which are stunning if you ask me). My 'snaps' with the Ricoh are at the top and I'll add the tranny scans when I get them. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFbMfQ9Z2jI/AAAAAAAAAhE/iwZP54JFlVc/s1600-h/dav.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SFbMfQ9Z2jI/AAAAAAAAAhE/iwZP54JFlVc/s400/dav.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5212578456228452914" /></a><br /><br /><br />The weather didn't stop us getting shots, in fact the weather made the pictures better - we only stopped when the camera bags started filling up ;-) Rainy weather just adds to the subtle drama of a location like this. One thing that did surprise me was that the mozzies were still active even though it was raining - bloody things. Dav also had a very neat little umbrella that you can attach to your flash bracket (he uses it on his Chamonix), very useful to keep the rain off your grads!

Joe had a couple of prints enalarged on duralumin to 6' x 4' (ish) and both were stunning. It's quite amazing the amount of pictures within pictures you can find when presented with such a large amount of information. The prints themselves gave you that feeling of being their, the peripheral vision working to pull you around the photograph.<br /><br />My favourites from the show were a quite intimate shot of water flowing over a gap in some falls. The only evidence of the water being the slight reflections as it flows over the rocks and the green tint of the water itself. Another was a completely snow bound valley with a frozen stream running through it. The other favourites were a shot of Glen Etive falls with a boulder and what looks like quartz layering in the foreground and another shot of Budle Bay in incredibly soft, high-key light. Damn.. and another was of bending reeds in a loch with glowing light - and another, and another.. <br /><br />If you get a chance to see the exhibition, please do so.. I also got to see a few regulars and a couple of people I haven't met before. Again the evening went far too fast and I had to dissapear off to the train station to catch the 9.30 back to Leeds.

This worked fine apart from the fact the combination is large and heavy. <br /><br />Joe was using a small digicam during the course with a Lee grad system mounted to it. The camera was a Ricoh GX100 and had a lot going for it as a finder replacment (especially considering it's a similar price to a linhof finder). Obvisouly it takes photos but most digicams only go as wide as 28mm wheras the Ricoh goes to 24mm.. This is the equivalent to about an 80mm lens. The zoom also goes out to 72mm which is equivalent to a 240mm lens. The lens also zooms in steps (28,35,50) which are equivalent to (93,115,170). These steps aren't a perfect match with my lenses but are close enough to give me a good idea of what lens to pick (good excuse to buy a 90mm too :).<br /><br />The ability to mount a lee filter system (the new RF75 kit which is being released in June) is one of the real attractions. To have something I can keep in my pocket with filter holder mounted and then just pull out and slip a grad in is quite cool. So far I've used the camera up at Twistleton and it's been a pleasure to compose with. I need to get used to the zoom settings on it (knowing which 'step' you are on is not immediatly obvious, but it doesn't need to be in most cases). The photographs in the previous post about Twistleton are from the Ricoh.<br /><br />I don't think I'll stop using the 5D completely but it will be demoted to jobs where I know I'm not walking far; the mix of usage is still open. <br /><br />It's also interesting to note that Joe said he would have to think carefully about buying another linhof finder, if a replacement were needed, as the Ricoh does such a good job.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDxJSuIjPgI/AAAAAAAAAg0/-oHKtCkqxM4/s1600-h/ricoh2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDxJSuIjPgI/AAAAAAAAAg0/-oHKtCkqxM4/s400/ricoh2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5205115855303818754" /></a>

In summary, it's a way of seeing how much you are magnifying the image by comparing a known size object with a calibrated ruler on the ground glass screen. <br /><br />The standard quick disc is printed on cardboard and hence gets smeared when wet and is difficult to read in the darkness of a dark cloth. <br /><br />I had a look around for something that I could use as a replacement for the disc and found a small mini cd that I got with my sans disk compact flash reader. It was just the right size and is obviously waterproof but has the bonus of standing out well from the background when measuring. <br /><br />For the ruler, I cut a peice of black plastic to size, sellotaped a scale on it but also cut notches in the ruler so I can read the silhouette against the ground glass screen.. Only a small thing but it makes it easier and hence more likely to be used..

I only took one photograph whilst out but did take a few snaps with my new Ricoh (more about this new camera in another post). <br /><br />Although the landscape is very impressive, it's quite difficult to simplify things to get a good composition. I think I was guilty of trying to hard to capture a single idea (in this case a single erratic boulder seen in the image below).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDsXpuIjPbI/AAAAAAAAAgM/lpXfa1CjRS4/s1600-h/R00100741.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDsXpuIjPbI/AAAAAAAAAgM/lpXfa1CjRS4/s400/R00100741.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5204779799882710450" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDsXp-IjPcI/AAAAAAAAAgU/CcNIvl7IcHg/s1600-h/R00100781.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDsXp-IjPcI/AAAAAAAAAgU/CcNIvl7IcHg/s400/R00100781.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5204779804177677762" /></a><br /><br />This image below was the only one I felt a little more confident about but it doesn't work in this light at all .. merely ideas at the moment.

The reason I'm showing both old and new now is that I've only just got around to scanning all of my images and here's why...<br /><br />So, straight after my trip to the Gower, I decided I couldn't wait any longer to get my own scans and after a lot of research, splashed out on an Epson v750. The alternative was to pay a little extra for a second hand drum scanner but the deciding factor was that for the majority of scanning I want to do, I don't need the extra resolution and DMax of the drum scanner and I definitely can do without the extra time taken to drum mount etc. So the answer was a domestic flat bed for the majority of my scanning with the possible option of buying a second hand Howtek, Creo/Eversmart or ICG later.<br /><br />First of all, I needed to work out how best to get good detail out of the v750 which means ... Testing!.. <br /><br />Well the first thing that needed testing was the optimum height at which to scan. The v750 is factory configured to about 3mm height above the glass but supposedly the actual focus point can be +/- 1 in some instances. I bought a betterscanning newton glass mount which allows you to tape a transparency to the underside of it and ensure a consistent scan height. I scanned up and down in 0.2mm increments and found my perfect height was 3.2mm. The actual resolution difference wasn't a great deal, possibly an extra 100-200 dpi.. <br /><br />Once this was complete, I tried scanning at different dpi to find out where the 'break point' was i.e. the point where extra dpi on the slider doesn't result in any increase in effective resolution. I tried quite a few resolutions and did see a jump around the 1600-2400 mark. If we say that the maximum resolution is typically a multiple of the native resolution, then the frankly ludicrous 28800 dpi should scale down to either 3200 or 1600. I tried scans at 1600, 2400 and 3200 and tried scaling the smaller ones up and could not tell a huge amount of difference. In fact, in some cases I saw more resolution out of the 1600 than the 2400.. I thought this was an anomoly but tried a few more times and it seems like the the 2400 and 3200 does some form of interpolation or double passing which smears fine detail. The 1600 dpi scan definitely holds a little more detail although it is undoubtedly slightly noisier. That said, if I reduce the noise with a good filtering program, the results are no worse than the 2400, 3200 scan. <br /><br />I also tried the double pass scanning which also smeared resolution and produced some strange patterning in the shadow detail. <br /><br />My final test was to see if 48 bit scanning made any difference and to my surprise it definitely did. The results were slightly sharper and less noisy so it appears that something wierd is going on in the downsampling algorithm in Silverfast. <br /><br />Anyway, by my real world tests, the best resolution to scan on ther v750 is 1600 dpi with no sharpening and at 48 bit.<br /><br />The output scans can take a reasonable amount of sharpening too and I always apply photokit capture sharpener which has a special setting for 4x5 transparencies. This just brings the sharpness up and avoids most haloing - but look out for sharp, high contrast edges where you can use expert capture sharpener and erase the sharpening on them.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the results I asked Joe Cornish to scan a transparency that I was working on using his Imacon and the results from the Epson were acceptable alongside it but with some reasonably large problems. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDiK7eIjPUI/AAAAAAAAAfU/kZYxI488cj0/s1600-h/imacon-vs-epson.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDiK7eIjPUI/AAAAAAAAAfU/kZYxI488cj0/s400/imacon-vs-epson.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5204062123732450626" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDiK7uIjPVI/AAAAAAAAAfc/5JP0eJ-sp_k/s1600-h/imacon-vs-epson2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDiK7uIjPVI/AAAAAAAAAfc/5JP0eJ-sp_k/s400/imacon-vs-epson2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5204062128027417938" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDiK7-IjPWI/AAAAAAAAAfk/rLPgcq2Az_4/s1600-h/imacon-vs-epson3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDiK7-IjPWI/AAAAAAAAAfk/rLPgcq2Az_4/s400/imacon-vs-epson3.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5204062132322385250" /></a><br /><br />The images to the right and at the bottom are the Epson versions.. The major issues are a lack of colour fidelity, colour problems in the shadows and haloing around high contrast edges. All of these things are hardly noticeable until pointed out or shown side by side. I'm happy with the compromise at the moment and will still be saving up for a drum scanner at some point to make the most out of my 'best' transparencies..<br /><br />I should also add that I can get more detail out with the v750 than I can see with a Schneider 10x loupe.<br /><br />Addendum :<br /><br />I've taken slices from the Rannoch moor photograph and uploaded them to Flickr. I've uploaded two photographs, one sharpened with Photokit Sharpener and one not. The order of the slices are shown is .. <br /><br />1) 1600 dpi - but I've tweaked the alignment of the red and blue layers to get rid of chromatic abberation<br />2) 1600 dpi - straight out of scanner<br />3) 1800 dpi<br />4) 2400 dpi<br />5) 3200 dpi<br /><br />The CA fix works quite well in getting rid of the red and blue smearing around highlights.. I'm going to have to play more with this. I've also been chatting with Julian Barkway who confirms my visual inspection that the 1600dpi scans are definitely sharper.<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timparkin/2525239268"><br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/timparkin/2525239268</a> - unsharpened<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timparkin/2524416493">http://www.flickr.com/photos/timparkin/2524416493</a> - sharpened<br /><br />Click on All sizes at the top of the photo and then click on the 'original' to see the full size 100% scan.<br /><br />I've also figured out a little more about the haloing that occurs, especially the large scale haloing as seen on the Gower worms head shot (at the top of the island). This appears to be caused by the direction of scan. Because the light spans the whole width of the scanner, when scanning a pixel in the middle of the picture, light from either side of the scanner will be causing flare in the lens which will cause a smearing across the picture. I tried changing the direction of the mount and lo and behold the smearing moved to either side of the island (in this case that was more acceptable).

It's a beautiful place with great hosts, food and service. <br /><br />First thing in the morning we drove over to Easdale to look at the beach where I took ne of my first large format shots. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXW6eIjPOI/AAAAAAAAAek/Hvc0i37GMK0/s1600-h/c.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXW6eIjPOI/AAAAAAAAAek/Hvc0i37GMK0/s400/c.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203301244506160354" /></a><br /><br />The morning was very sunny but had a strong sea mist. I wanted to take a picture of the strange tree like feature that Richard had shown me last time we were there.. I've still to find out what the feature is but it made for a strong composition, especially with the simplifying nature of the haze.<br /><br />Charlotte then dropped me off at the Gallery where we joined up with seven other photographers and after a quick bite to eat and a gossip we went off to our workshop locations which was .... Easdale!! Well we didn't go to the beach (not that I would have been unhappy to) but went instead to the small harbour. <br /><br />The geology was extraordinary with a combination of slate, basalt, quartz and even some sandstone. I wanted to capture the essence of the place and again the haze helped. A short crossing over a scary wall and I had the raise platform that allowed me to get away from the black stained rocks and up around the polished slate layers. The main photograph was a bugger to expose, with the reflections in the water being incredibly bright.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXW5-IjPMI/AAAAAAAAAeU/xv1nnuS6Xms/s1600-h/a.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXW5-IjPMI/AAAAAAAAAeU/xv1nnuS6Xms/s400/a.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203301235916225730" /></a><br /><br />The photograph above is one I also really like for it's stillness. The harbour has a natural wier at the entrance which means the water is millpond smooth and I wanted to capture the reflections of the layers of rock in the background but also to capture the wall at man made wall and the way it blended into the rock. I think I capture the nature of the location with these two photographs and am very happy with them. <br /><br />The exhibition in the evening was predictably very good with some new work by both Joe and David but it was great to see some of Richard's new work, particularly his amazing picture of Seilabost sands which I've included below with a couple more of my favourites of his.<br /><br />Richard is a challenging role model for someone who has only been taking landscape photographs for four years and now runs his own successful gallery. Congratulations Richard!!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXhveIjPPI/AAAAAAAAAes/0MMICCGyYZs/s1600-h/00069626_p.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXhveIjPPI/AAAAAAAAAes/0MMICCGyYZs/s400/00069626_p.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203313150155504882" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXhvuIjPQI/AAAAAAAAAe0/iuuuLDOsL34/s1600-h/00103049_p.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXhvuIjPQI/AAAAAAAAAe0/iuuuLDOsL34/s400/00103049_p.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203313154450472194" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXhvuIjPRI/AAAAAAAAAe8/6ptoT__3f0Q/s1600-h/00094646_p.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXhvuIjPRI/AAAAAAAAAe8/6ptoT__3f0Q/s400/00094646_p.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203313154450472210" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXhv-IjPSI/AAAAAAAAAfE/sjsvJBAzzA8/s1600-h/00074850_p.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXhv-IjPSI/AAAAAAAAAfE/sjsvJBAzzA8/s400/00074850_p.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203313158745439522" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXhv-IjPTI/AAAAAAAAAfM/sXH3z1V1RHc/s1600-h/00120950_p.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXhv-IjPTI/AAAAAAAAAfM/sXH3z1V1RHc/s400/00120950_p.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203313158745439538" /></a>

He has a distinct and graphic vision and I was looking forward to working together to see how he interprets the landscape. <br /><br />We went out on the Friday afternoon and explored the area on the West side of the Ingleton valley, an area known that looks over Twistleton Scar and Whernside. The particular area we explored was called Keld Head Scar and Cheese Press Stone. Nigel worked on a couple of shots, searching for repeating patterns in the landscape or distince graphical shapes. The Cheese press stone picture in particular is a very masculine shot and one that shows symmetry, repeating patterns, graphical shapes, etc.  <br /><br />It was really interesting to be out in the field with someone who knows what they want to find and who has a great deal of skill in getting it. As the day went on, we worked our way across quite an area and we both got pictures we were happy with. My picture from the Friday is very different, obviously a lot less graphical and 'standard' but I was trying to introduce some graphical structure through the lines in the grass curves at the bottom of the picture. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXQ1eIjPLI/AAAAAAAAAeM/xhurhZQ-bYA/s1600-h/2502717909_2531ef1c13.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SDXQ1eIjPLI/AAAAAAAAAeM/xhurhZQ-bYA/s400/2502717909_2531ef1c13.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5203294561537047730" /></a><br /><br />On the Saturday morning we got up early and went over to Brimham Rocks for first light. I couldn't find anything I was happy with but explored the area with a more critical eye than I had previously which showed many more opportunities than I had originally thought of. It proved to me again that whatever the location, don't be blinkered by expectations and spend longer looking at each aspect of an area.<br /><br />After a brief rest (mornings are soo tiring) we drove back over to Keld Head Scar again and spent a little longer exploring. This time Nigel got the picture at the top of this article and I spent too long looking for something without seeing, writers block as it were.<br /><br />Nigel showed me a lot about how to see in the landscape and I enjoyed every minute, even the breakfast in Woolworths :-)

It's been a bit of a hectic month since Gower and I haven't posted as much as I'd like due to scanning, website design, photography trips and exhibitions.  I'm going to try catching up on these over the next few days.<br /><br />The first post Gower trip was to London to see David and Anna's exhibition at the OXO gallery on the South Bank. I arrived early to see if I could help in any way and chatted with Paula (Pell-Johnson of Linhof Studios), Anna, David and Kyriakos (Kalakortis - <a href="http://kkpictures.com/">http://kkpictures.com/</a>). David tasked me and KK to put up stickers for his prints which we boldy screwed up niceley (how can something so simple go wrong!)..<br /><br />Once the opening time arrived, the throng surged in until the place was so full it wasn't easy to see the pictures. Fortunately I'd got a good look around earlier on and I have to say that both David and Anna's pictures were very, very good. I'm familiar with David's pictures already but seeing them in print (especially the large ones) was a different matter. Anna's were totally unfamiliar and although her style is similar to David's in some ways, she has more of an open feel to her compositions and is less transformative than David. My favourites of Anna's were her Dune Grasses, KMK Doorway,  Quarry Fern and, for instant appeal along, Peeling Bark  2<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.annaphotobooth.com/images_photobooth/3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.annaphotobooth.com/images_photobooth/3.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.annaphotobooth.com/images_photobooth/1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.annaphotobooth.com/images_photobooth/1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.annaphotobooth.com/images_photobooth/14.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.annaphotobooth.com/images_photobooth/14.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.annaphotobooth.com/images_photobooth/15.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.annaphotobooth.com/images_photobooth/15.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />David's most appealing ones were Boats, Rock Fins, Engineers House and Empty Sea<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/29/mainImage?size=600x632&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/29/mainImage?size=400x500&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/45/mainImage?size=600x632&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/45/mainImage?size=400x500&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/74/mainImage?size=600x632&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/74/mainImage?size=400x500&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/173/mainImage?size=600x632&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/173/mainImage?size=400x500&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />One of the things that struck me about the exhibition was how well the images worked without frames. The smaller prints were just hung, washing like style, on a wire line running down the gallery walls. The larger prints were mounted on aluminium, printed on epson luster with a matt coating. These prints looked absolutely stunning. They were big enough to really demonstrate the immense detail that the large format image shows and yet were still enjoyable as a whole if you walked a distance away. The sense of depth to the images was intense. <br /><br />Another thing that struck me is how nice a lot of the people were that came to the exhibition. I spoke to Kyriakos at some length but I also spoke to Richard Holroyd, Mel & Jeremy Foster, Paul Wakefield, Joe Cornish, Roger Longdin, Gerry Gavigan, Nigel Halliwell and many more. My only real complaint about the evening is that it couldn't carry on any longer!

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT-5rulkKI/AAAAAAAAAcE/0ovqoSsbpOw/s1600-h/63a.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT-5rulkKI/AAAAAAAAAcE/0ovqoSsbpOw/s400/63a.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194056537209147554" /></a><br /><br />OK so there may be no such word as Graddage but it is so important to landscape photography, and especially with transparency film, that perhaps there should be. ("The Black Art of knowing just which grad to pick to get the best transition between maximum effect of the grad to transparent" didn't quite have the same kick).<br /><br />This topic was something I wanted to research for a while but an article over at the <a href="http://singhray.blogspot.com/2008/01/does-size-matter-darwin-wiggett-puts.html">Singh Ray blog</a>. Darwin Wigget does an excellent job in real world experimentation and the results are enlightening but I hope to add a little to the discussion.<br /><br />So what is all the fuss about, shouldn't we just work out how many stops we need and then pick the appropriate grad? Well you could but then you'd have to choose a hard or a soft and you'd better know how fast that transition will happen otherwise what could have been a perfect photo will have a hard dark break in it or you will still end up with burnt out skies. <br /><br />So how fast does a grad transition from dark to light? This depends on the manufacturer, but with a couple of quick measurements, Lee and Singh Ray filters seem to have a transition for hard grads of about 10mm and for soft grads about 50mm. <br /><br />The way this transition transfers onto film or sensor is dependant on quite a few things. The main ones I will be looking at are the distance the grad is from the lens, the focal length, the type of lens design and the aperture. <br /><br />Firstly it's probably good to mention the possible flaw in the Singh Ray article. The lens that was used for most of the test results was a 17-40mm. This lens is of a design that is peculiar to SLR wide angles. It's called a 'retrofocus' lens and it's existence is mostly to get around the problem that once you get to very wide focal lengths on an SLR, the mirror gets in the way of standard lens design (e.g. for a 17mm lens, the focal point of the lens would have to be 17mm from the sensor. Not feasible).<br /><br />If we look at the diagram below we can see my crude effort to show how a standard lens works and how it 'sees' the grad.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT1dLulj8I/AAAAAAAAAaU/NSA98hwOhXA/s1600-h/Page+1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT1dLulj8I/AAAAAAAAAaU/NSA98hwOhXA/s400/Page+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194046151978225602" /></a><br /><br />So the distance from the point where the light rays cross to the film/sensor is the focal length of the lens. Here is a wide angle design showing how the focal point is closer to the senor. Notice how on the wide angle design, the transition point is harder.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT23rulj9I/AAAAAAAAAac/9bA0Et-MArE/s1600-h/Page+2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT23rulj9I/AAAAAAAAAac/9bA0Et-MArE/s400/Page+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194047706756386770" /></a><br /><br />If we now look at a retrofocus design, we can see how the lens rays are moved into a more parralel path (this is also a good thing for sensors as they don't like having light arriving at them at sharp angles, something Leica know a thing or two about). <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT2_bulj-I/AAAAAAAAAak/m9nXw9AaR3A/s1600-h/Page+3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT2_bulj-I/AAAAAAAAAak/m9nXw9AaR3A/s400/Page+3.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194047839900372962" /></a><br /><br />Because the grad is so close to the 'nodal point' of the lens (the point where the light rays would have crossed if they hadn't been munged by retrofocusness and other effects - shown on the picture as a green crossing point), the transition is very soft. However, moving the grad a little further away from the lens, by putting it in the last slot for instance, makes the transition harder quite quickly.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT3cbulj_I/AAAAAAAAAas/3IPy-kDq0_c/s1600-h/Page+10.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT3cbulj_I/AAAAAAAAAas/3IPy-kDq0_c/s400/Page+10.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194048338116579314" /></a><br /><br />Also, retrofocus design lenses have an aperture that isn't near the nodal point of the lens.. Before I can explain how this makes a difference I'll try to explain why the aperture makes a difference in the first place. <br /><br />So what about long lenses? Well Here we get a little more complicated because some long lenses also play with the light paths and hence the same focal length can have differing hardnesses of transition depending on how this happens. The following two diagrams show a long lens where the first is simple and the second has some juggery pockery going on to increase the aperture.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBW-EbulkLI/AAAAAAAAAcM/XNXt8jG92Rw/s1600-h/Page+4.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBW-EbulkLI/AAAAAAAAAcM/XNXt8jG92Rw/s400/Page+4.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194266728613646514" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBW-ErulkMI/AAAAAAAAAcU/xh-TepgJUus/s1600-h/Page+5.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBW-ErulkMI/AAAAAAAAAcU/xh-TepgJUus/s400/Page+5.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194266732908613826" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br />If we have a lens with a very small aperture, we can see that the grad transition is projected accurately through the lens to the sensor/film. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT4GbulkAI/AAAAAAAAAa0/Jf8nmNfItfg/s1600-h/Page+11.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT4GbulkAI/AAAAAAAAAa0/Jf8nmNfItfg/s400/Page+11.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194049059671085058" /></a><br /><br />If we have a larger aperture however, the grad is effectively 'blurred' (after all it is out of focus). This blur changes the density at the top and bottom of the sensor/film. The following two show how the density at the top of the sensor changes.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT4nLulkBI/AAAAAAAAAa8/weSBYrjaeec/s1600-h/Page+6.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT4nLulkBI/AAAAAAAAAa8/weSBYrjaeec/s400/Page+6.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194049622311800850" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT4nbulkCI/AAAAAAAAAbE/H_cEkt30k1A/s1600-h/Page+7.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT4nbulkCI/AAAAAAAAAbE/H_cEkt30k1A/s400/Page+7.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194049626606768162" /></a><br /><br />and the following show how the density at the bottom changes<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT41bulkEI/AAAAAAAAAbU/58JgvZTajn8/s1600-h/Page+9.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT41bulkEI/AAAAAAAAAbU/58JgvZTajn8/s400/Page+9.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194049867124936770" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT41LulkDI/AAAAAAAAAbM/KQFIb2QzC8s/s1600-h/Page+8.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT41LulkDI/AAAAAAAAAbM/KQFIb2QzC8s/s400/Page+8.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194049862829969458" /></a><br /><br />This means the gradient is a lot softer as shown below<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT5CLulkFI/AAAAAAAAAbc/hhCH9Xk_b2s/s1600-h/Page+11.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT5CLulkFI/AAAAAAAAAbc/hhCH9Xk_b2s/s400/Page+11.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194050086168268882" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT5CbulkGI/AAAAAAAAAbk/o7EjcxBvKWs/s1600-h/Page+12.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT5CbulkGI/AAAAAAAAAbk/o7EjcxBvKWs/s400/Page+12.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194050090463236194" /></a><br /><br />The amount of blur is dependant on the width of the aperture (which is focal length / fstop). I'll expand on this a little at the end. <br /><br />The aperture in a retrofocus lens isn't in the same position as a normal lens and doesn't have the same effect on hardness as on a normal lens. Now I can't work out how much effect it should have because the lenses are particularly complicated and it may be that I'm wrong in how this affects the transition but it would make sense to use a standard design as well as the retrofocus design in order to provide a balanced result (perhaps someone can contribute?). In reality, it's good to know that the aperture doesn't have as large effect on the 17-40 as it's a very common landscape lens.<br /><br />For large format photographers, we're in less complicated territory. The following diagram shows a couple of lenses that I own and I hope to show how the transition hardness is affected across the other lenses I own. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT7HrulkHI/AAAAAAAAAbs/JXURZ2do8rQ/s1600-h/Page+13.gif"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT7HrulkHI/AAAAAAAAAbs/JXURZ2do8rQ/s400/Page+13.gif" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194052379680804978" /></a><br /><br />The distance between the lens board and the grad plays a big part in the hardness of the transition as the length of the transition on film is equal to the length on the grad divided by the distance from lens board to grad and multiplied by the focal length. The following table shows this calculation for all of the lenses I own.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT72LulkII/AAAAAAAAAb0/_bXERYn5fLo/s1600-h/table.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBT72LulkII/AAAAAAAAAb0/_bXERYn5fLo/s400/table.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5194053178544722050" /></a><br /><br />All measurements are in millimeters. The transition length is the distance it takes to go from transparent to full density on the film surface. The percentage is the proportion of the film that the transition zone covers (presuming portrait orientation  5x4 film).<br /><br />You can easily see that on the 80mm, a transition percetage of 13% makes for a hard grad, wheras on the 240mm, the transition zone is 55% of the frame, no good for hard horizon sunsets then.<br /><br />With soft grads, the 240mm is almost useless.. A 3 stop soft grad would only get the chance to get 2 stops of transition in. On the 80mm, the soft grad has the full transition across 70% of the frame. <br /><br />This makes Joe Cornishes full range of custom 'Extra Hard' grads understandable. I imagine he knows from experience how fast a grad transitions depending on what lens he is using. After doing these calculations I know realise I've got a big Lee filter bill coming too :-)<br /><br />My next job is to work out just how much the aperture affects the transition on my large format lenses.. My gut feeling says that at f22+ it won't have much effect but I'd like to know how much you need to stop down to get a representative effect (to make focussing easier for instance).<br /><br />I hope with your new found Graddage skills that the right grad is now a little less of a hit or miss affair.<br /><br />I started the post with  picture I took on the way back from my Gower Light and Land trip. I'd stopped at a layby right in the middle of Wales (near Welshpool) and this was the view I was presented with when I walked to the bottom of the car park. I put this image up because it ended up very dark across the top of the land. I'd used a 2 stop hard grad and wanted to stop back the sky but not the land. The picture you see had to be worked on quite a bit to get things back and orderly. I now know that with my 240mm lens, I really need an extra hard grad to accomplish the effect I wanted and the reason that the land was so dark is that it was underexposed by a stop or two because the transition zone overlapped the land by about a third..  I'll post the original picture up when I get chance.

The impetus for the gadget came about when I was purchasing and testing various lens hoods for the Ebony and my range of lenses. I'm probably a little anal about trying to use a lens hood where possible but from the research I've done, the case for using a lens hood with a large format camera is a lot stronger than for an SLR or Medium Format one. <br /><br />Firstly it's probably useful to cover why we should use lens hoods at all. The main reason often quoted is to reduce flare if the sun is shining directly onto the front element of a lens. The type of flare that most people think about in these situations is of the highlight flare with multiple reflections, the one that you can simulate in photoshop (if you really wanted to). The following is an example of this type of flare.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpDG7ulkNI/AAAAAAAAAcc/y9tOT2ERKUE/s1600-h/simpleflare.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpDG7ulkNI/AAAAAAAAAcc/y9tOT2ERKUE/s400/simpleflare.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195538906516656338" /></a><br /><br />But you can also get less dramatic flare when you don't expect it, often just because the sun is directly shining on the lens. The <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/lens-flare.htm">article at Cambridge on Colour</a> (great website in general) is very good and shows a diagram of this and the following pictures also show examples..<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpDHbulkOI/AAAAAAAAAck/gW9xJu0WWLA/s1600-h/complexlensflare.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpDHbulkOI/AAAAAAAAAck/gW9xJu0WWLA/s400/complexlensflare.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195538915106590946" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpDHrulkPI/AAAAAAAAAcs/A8mOfKGt5I4/s1600-h/unexpectedoutsideshotflare.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpDHrulkPI/AAAAAAAAAcs/A8mOfKGt5I4/s400/unexpectedoutsideshotflare.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195538919401558258" /></a><br /><br />More insidious however is 'veiling flare' which only really shows up as a lack of contrast in the picture. This can be caused by many things from internal reflections in the lens from many sources (so there is an averaging of many point sources to create an overal fogging) or could be caused by bellows flare (excess light entering the camera and bouncing around inside the bellows. <br /><br />I've created a set of little diagrams to show how the large image circle of large format lenses can create bellows flare. Firstly we have an imaginary me taking a picture of a flower in a cave (not something I've done by the way) and as you can see, the sun is behind me so there is no need for a lens hood.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpJXbulkRI/AAAAAAAAAc8/w0PsULhAm3U/s1600-h/0.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpJXbulkRI/AAAAAAAAAc8/w0PsULhAm3U/s400/0.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195545787054264594" /></a><br /><br />However I'm using a lens with a very large image circle. I've posted a comparison of image circles before but it's not unknown for the image circle to be three times as big as the film area (the 110XL for instance). If we look at the what happens if we plot where the image circle goes we get as follows.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpJXrulkSI/AAAAAAAAAdE/eiJS-NQY9Mg/s1600-h/1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpJXrulkSI/AAAAAAAAAdE/eiJS-NQY9Mg/s400/1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195545791349231906" /></a><br /><br />Oops.. we can see that the image circle is taking in the light from the clouds and also the light from the lake in front of the cave. The clouds are at EV15 and the lake  is EV12, out flower in the cave is at EV6 so any stray light can easily fog the film. <br /><br />Finally, if we look at a ray of light coming from the clouds and through the lens, we can see that it is lighting up the inside of the bellows. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpJX7ulkTI/AAAAAAAAAdM/-AnLE-m96vQ/s1600-h/2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpJX7ulkTI/AAAAAAAAAdM/-AnLE-m96vQ/s400/2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195545795644199218" /></a><br /><br />Even though the reflections of this light are reduced a lot because of the way the bellows is constructed and the material it's made of, very bright light sources can very easily fog the shadows of a low light exposure. This will show itself as a reduced contrast over either the whole picture or graduated over one side of the picture. One way of recognising it is that a strip at the edge of the frame will possibly be full contrast because the contruction of the back standard blocks the light from the bellows slightly.<br /><br />The only way to stop this happening is to limit the light entering the lens by adding a lens hood as follows.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpN8bulkUI/AAAAAAAAAdU/2yfy-wjlQQY/s1600-h/3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpN8bulkUI/AAAAAAAAAdU/2yfy-wjlQQY/s400/3.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195550820755935554" /></a><br /><br />So now I've said why, what is it that I've actually done. Well.. when I bought a Lee wide angle hood and a standard hood from Robert White. After checking for vignetting using my different lenses, I found that there was no way of using graduated filter with the lens hood without also using a tandem adapter. The extra thickness added by this tandem adapter and second Lee holder caused the 80mm to vignette. The problem being that lens hoods are designed to be mounted square to the camera. If you do this, the slot for a filter in the lens hood can't be used for grads at any angle other than 90 degrees. <br /><br />So I got to thinking how I could possibly use the wide angle hood without having to sacrifice grad usage (or be limited to only using grads with a horizontal orientation). I figured the only way I could get it to work is if I stuck the filter on with something like blue tack. Then I remembered seeing an article about a german company that sold super strong magnets. These magnets could hold incredible weights and were only about 4mm in daimeter. So I ordered a bunch of these and after a few hours playing (magnets are really good fun! apart from when your business partner borrows some and sticks them to his keys, forgetting that he has a USB memory stick for a keyring.. oh dear) I started drilling holes in the Lee adapter used on gthe wide angle hood and mounted 24 of these magnets by drilling all the way through the adapter and using araldite to embed them. Then I cut some new adapter wings out of an old biscuit tin and attached them to my Lee push on holder (to fit the Centre Filter of the 80mm XL lens). The result is shown in the following photographs. I've also included a picture of my 110 lens mounted with a tandem adapter to show the difference in thickness. <br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpQlrulkVI/AAAAAAAAAdc/QMf9_d_ntc0/s1600-h/IMG_66931.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpQlrulkVI/AAAAAAAAAdc/QMf9_d_ntc0/s400/IMG_66931.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195553728448794962" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpQmLulkWI/AAAAAAAAAdk/oXcuY_oo6h4/s1600-h/IMG_66951.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpQmLulkWI/AAAAAAAAAdk/oXcuY_oo6h4/s400/IMG_66951.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195553737038729570" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpQmbulkXI/AAAAAAAAAds/xL7PWC5hGBQ/s1600-h/IMG_66981.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpQmbulkXI/AAAAAAAAAds/xL7PWC5hGBQ/s400/IMG_66981.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195553741333696882" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpQm7ulkYI/AAAAAAAAAd0/JNJqKk0J7z4/s1600-h/IMG_67001.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpQm7ulkYI/AAAAAAAAAd0/JNJqKk0J7z4/s400/IMG_67001.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195553749923631490" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpQnLulkZI/AAAAAAAAAd8/JXuId8vWMeY/s1600-h/IMG_67011.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpQnLulkZI/AAAAAAAAAd8/JXuId8vWMeY/s400/IMG_67011.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195553754218598802" /></a><br /><br />The magnets are strong enough to hold the whole lens hood assembly even when the camer is pointing straight down. One of the unexpected benefits was found out when I was taking the picture of the succulents in Gower. I was using a LOT of tilt and rise and ran into vignetting problems at one side of the picture. However, because the hood isn't centered on an adapter, I could slide the whole assembly down a bit to line it up with the rise that had been applied. Effectively I moved the whole of the hood image circle down to match the amount of rise I had applied. You can hopefully see this in the image below.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpR0bulkaI/AAAAAAAAAeE/x6EyFsVzjKE/s1600-h/IMG_66991.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/SBpR0bulkaI/AAAAAAAAAeE/x6EyFsVzjKE/s400/IMG_66991.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195555081363493282" /></a><br /><br />The Light and Land crew were suitably impressed (actually their expressions could have been interpreted as incredulity at my obsessive compulsive behaviour - but I chose not to) and they've now challenged me to produce a new gadget for them, a self demisting ground glass screen. I think they may have been joking but 'I have a cunning plan'...

Clever, liveley, helpful and with a good dose of irreverance (mostly from David) to break up the quite philosophical discussions about the art of photography. <br /><br />Thirdly, it must be something about large format people but the company, 10 folk including myself, was a pleasure to be with. <br /><br />Fourthly I had loads of fun with my big camera; trying out some gadgets I've made (more on that later), borrowing bits of equipment from other people to try and getting to see what other people play with. <br /><br />I've started this post with a scan of one of my favourite pictures from the week, taken on Three Cliffs beach. Those pointy bits are the three cliffs and the plant in the foreground is called "Sea Stock", a rare succulent only found in North Devon, Cornwall and South Wales. As you can probably tell, there was a bit of a downpour just before this shot was taken but it served to hide some of the foot steps (just).<br /><br />The photo was taken with my 80mm lens, which is normally very dark in the corners and a bit of a pain to focus. However, I'd just borrowed a spare Ebony ground glass and back from Joe Cornish which was fitted with the Ebony wide angle fresnel. What a difference!! What was black in the corners (unless you move your head) was now a nice even tone all the way across the picture! Also, this meant that it's a lot nicer to focus. So I gave myself a nice difficult 15-20 degree back tilt shot to test it out with :-)  The reflections in the water under the peaks was also a driver for this shot and I had to get about 5 inches away from the plant to take this shot. I used a couple of grads, a two stop with the grad horizontal just below the horizon and a 1 stop that was covering the top right half of the picture to compensate a but for the bellows factor with the plant being so close.<br /><br />Whilst I'm talking about ground glass though, Joe also showed me his Maxwell screen which was also highly lustable. It's 'very' bright and consistent and the fresnel is hardly visible even under a loupe. Even better, there are no markings on it at all.. Personally I find grid lines and centre circles distracting and to see the picture on a clear ground glass screen which is bright and even was beautiful..  Unfortunately they're not cheap but as I've said previously, the time I spend behind the ground glass is one of the moments I really enjoy in life and if anything removes my disconnect with the subject and increases this enjoyment, even better.<br /><br />The Light and Land courses are wonderful and I can totally understand why people keep coming back again and again (in some cases taking 3 or 4 courses a year for over 7 years!).<br /><br />My next course is hopefully in Glencoe in January of next year and I'm already getting excited :-)

<div class='post-header-line-1'></div>
<div class='post-body entry-content'>
One of the first key decisions I discussed with David was how big should we present images to the user. The influencing factors on this decision are as follows<br /><br /> * Portraying the highest quality images to the user<br /> * Ensuring that the images cannot be missapropriated<br /><br />The balancing act between these two factors will give us a size at which we are happy to use. In order to assess these two factors I will go into some details about each one.<h2>Portraying the highest quality images to the user</h2>We all wish to capture a level of detail in our images that goes well beyond the resolution of a computer screen. When we come to represent those images to a user we shrink the images to a point where we don't think they are of any use to 'pirates'. This typically means shrinking them to where they are also of little use to most users.  <br /><br />The typical size of a web gallery image appears to be about 300px x 450px , a size that is poor even by cheap mobile phone standards. I've yet to meet a photographer that would happy to show there hard graft to a potential customer or browser on a cheap mobile phone and yet most will proudly talk about their new website and how well it shows there work. <br /><br />Most professional cameras/scanners these days will produce files of approx 4000px x 3000px and if you are working with large format files, 6000px x 8000px and more is not unheard off. This means that the average size web image is showing 1.1% of the image that was taken or, if you are of the large format persuasion,  0.3% of the image is shown. In my personal opinion as someone who likes to browse other peoples work, this is a real shame. <br /><br />A typical photo oriented monitor these days (i.e. one of about &#163;250-&#163;300) is approx 1680px x 1050px which means the little picture at 300px x 450px is only taking up 13% of the screen! <br /><br />Let's think about what resolution image we would have if we were to try to make the most of this common screen size. For a portrait image on an SLR, this would be 666px x 1000px . If this were to be printed up at 300dpi, we would have a 2.2" x 3.3" picture. Even if we were to print this at a just about acceptable 150 dpi, we would still only have a 4.5" x 6.6" picture which would make a lowish resolution postcard printed using sRGB colour which has a low colour range. <br /><br />So, if we are happy to risk the possiblity that someone will print out a picture postcard sized print at low quality of one of our shots then we can provide screen filling goodness for our customers and browsers!<h2>Portraying the highest quality images to the user</h2>OK, so now the down side of putting images on the web. People can pinch them and use them for personal use or possibly to make money for themselves. This is obviously a serious matter. The general ethos at the moment in photography is to try to make sure that there can be no piracy at all by making the picture too small to be useful. We should also consider that this will inevitably mean a reduction in possible sales as people cannot see the product at it's best.<br /><br />What we have is a classic cost/benefit problem for which there is a 'best' point at which the additional sales gained by having higher quality images is overtaken by the actual losses caused by picture piracy. <br /><br />Wait a moment though, we need to work out a way to calculate the actual losses due to piracy. I've spent quite a while browsing around the web and asking colleagues about who has actually lost revenue from this problem and I could not find anybody who said they were personally worse off because of piracy. There were a few people who had found there images being sold elsewhere but those sales did not reduce the photographers actual sales (in fact, when the pirates customers found out in one case, they licensed the photographs from the original photographer!).<br /><br />Lets take a look at this from the eyes of a potential pirate. We can probably classify them as 'personal users', 'small time opportunists', 'career fraudsters' and 'organised crime'. <br /><br />I think we can discount organised crime here because they seem to have other ways of making lots of money. I also think we can discount career fraudsters as if photographers have problems making money out of their own pictures, it's not really an attractive fraud opportunity. So we're left with personal users and small time opportunists. The personal users aren't costing any money but I can understand that some people object to unauthourised use. The opportunists are the real problem but generally they only cost the photographer money once the photographer has discovered what is going on. At that point, it's up to the photographer to take action and prove the opportunist has broken the law. <br /><br />The people I have spoken to who have said this has happened have mostly said it's been for use on websites or for little pictures in articles, in which case, the 300px x 450px is more than usable for this. <br /><br />If an opportunist really wanted to pirate material to make some serious money and costs the photographer revenue, they could order original prints or buy rights managed or royalty free pictures and pass them off as their own. No amount of web asset size restriction will prevent this. <br /><br />Now my 'boat' is landscape photography so some of the discussion I'm having is probably not relevant to the photographer who makes money out of selling stock images for web use; but for most art 'style' commercal photographers, I find it difficult to beleive that the availability of a postcard size images will  create serious revenue loss. <br /><br />However, as I've said, I can see revenue loss from a lack of good product representation.<br /><br />So this conversation was had with David and the conclusion was to go for screen filling goodness. There was one precaution I wanted to take though.<h2>Final Precautions</h2>The Internet is being 'crawled' by search engines all of the time and you can use google or other tools to find lots of images without having to browse through lots of websites. Hence it is more than likeley that images will appear somewhere on the web without the associated copyright footer. <br /><br />This presents a 'plausibly deniable' opportunity to a fraudster. They can say that they found the image on some search engine and didn't know it was copyright restricted.<br /><br />In order to get around this, all of the larger images on David's website have a footer attached in the same background colour as the site (so that it doesn't appear to get in the way of the picture). If the image gets indexed by some search engine and then gets picked up by someone wanting to use it, the image still has a footer which includes copyright statement and contact details. The fraudster would have to manually remove the footer and this gives any prosecution the evidence to prove active 'intent' to remove copyright notices.<h2>Some Last Points</h2>People always ask about watermarks to prevent theft but I generally think that making an image unusable also renders it almost unusable as a promotional tool.<br /><br />The postcard comparison came about when I saw the Fuji promotional material that includes high quality postcard size images of some of David Ward, Joe Cornish and Charlie Waite's best work. If this isn't seen as a piracy opportunity, good size images for web use shouldn't either.<br /><br />I'd love to hear about other opinions on this matter though so please let rip.. :-)

I've launched a website for one of the UK's (and possibly the world's) finest landscape photographers, been on a course in Wales with this person and another of the World's finest landscape photographers, created a couple of product customisations (magnetic lee filter and waterproof quick disc that works in the dark) and bought some new equipment and books. <br /><br />Trying to write up the whole lot in one block is a little daunting so I'm going to spread them out over the next week or so and accompany them with some pictures taken whilst in Wales.<br /><br />Firstly there is the website I've built for David Ward, a photographer I particularly admire and one whose best work had no representation in the public domain. A little back story first though. I went on a photographic holiday in the Hebrides with a company called Light and Land last year (pictures posted on some of the first posts in this blog). The leader of the course was David Ward who had brought some work to show people and who also made a big impression on my understanding of why I take pictures. I was very surprised to hear that David didn't have a website and mentioned to him that I'd be happy to build one for him if he was interested. <br /><br />Over the next few months, as well as immersing myself in large format photograph (damn you David) I also designed a look and feel for the website and planned out content and how it would work. The site was launched two weeks ago and most of the bugs seem to be ironed out now. Have a look at http://www.into-the-light.com and let me know what you think. Your feedback will go directly into the website if it's good!<br /><br />I personally am very happy with the results and the decisions made to get to where we are. <br /><br />Some of those decisions are fundamental to how we photographers portray ourselves on the web. The biggest decision is the size of images which I will be discussing in my next blog post.

My parents have a caravan just outside Windemere and we drove over on Easter Sunday morning in blanket snow conditions. <br /><br />The weather warnings (typically hysterical) must have put people off as there were very few cars on the road and when we went for a walk on the Sunday, we only saw a couple of people. There were so few people that myself and my Dad thought we'd risk a drive over to Blea Tarn on the Monday morning. The picture at the top was taken after spending a good 2 hours looking around a small tarn for interesting compositions (the one with the boat was the best I found). We decided to finish things off and go for a drink thinking that was it for the day. Upon leaving the pub, this view greeted us from the front door, a quick draw camera action grabbed it just as the 'interesting' cloud diffused the sun. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R-rAuspr19I/AAAAAAAAAZ4/5MUw4I_5yvM/s1600-h/IMG_64771.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R-rAuspr19I/AAAAAAAAAZ4/5MUw4I_5yvM/s400/IMG_64771.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5182166229735692242" /></a><br /><br />We got to Blea Tarn in sunny conditions and walked up from Dungeon Ghyll to Blea Tarn ( a 45 degree climb of only about half a mile but with 58lbs of gear it's pretty hard on the legs).<br /><br />You have to understand that Blea Tarn is a mecca for photographers for the two reasons that make Lochan Na h'Achlaise a mecca, great view, 50 yds from a parking spot. We only saw six photographers this time and the weather wasn't great but we did have a great walk. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R-q_i8pr18I/AAAAAAAAAZw/GJneoj8zQ1k/s1600-h/IMG_64951.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R-q_i8pr18I/AAAAAAAAAZw/GJneoj8zQ1k/s400/IMG_64951.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5182164928360601538" /></a><br /><br /><br />On the way down, the legendary Lakes weather shut everything down from a sunny day to 50m visibility in about 5 minutes. <br /><br />Overall a very enjoyable trip and a couple of OK shots.

The options we discussed were 1) using the ratio of the short edges 2) using the ratio of the long edges 3) using the ratio of the diagonals.. <br /><br />First of all here is the 4x5 sample shot.. we'll presume this was taken with a 150mm lens<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9Gtv-PEnPI/AAAAAAAAAXI/LdvJl6dES5g/s1600-h/4x5.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9Gtv-PEnPI/AAAAAAAAAXI/LdvJl6dES5g/s400/4x5.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175108486497082610" /></a><br /><br />The ratio of the long edges would give 120mm (for the 4x5) to 170mm (for 6x17) which is 1.4:1 - so if we were to use a 210mm lens we would get the following<br /><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9GtwOPEnQI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/SjhleIg93Ws/s1600-h/ratio-of-long.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9GtwOPEnQI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/SjhleIg93Ws/s400/ratio-of-long.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175108490792049922" /></a><br /><br />If we use the ration of the short edges we us 95mm (for the 4x5) and 60mm (for the 6x17 we get 0.63:1 - so we use a 94mm lens and get ...<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9GtxePEnRI/AAAAAAAAAXY/i_Orzs_-WdE/s1600-h/ratio-of-short.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9GtxePEnRI/AAAAAAAAAXY/i_Orzs_-WdE/s400/ratio-of-short.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175108512266886418" /></a><br /><br />finally we try the ratio of the diagonals 1.17:1 which gives 175mm which gives<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9GtxuPEnSI/AAAAAAAAAXg/PGrK-UDXEkE/s1600-h/ratio-of-diagonal.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9GtxuPEnSI/AAAAAAAAAXg/PGrK-UDXEkE/s400/ratio-of-diagonal.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175108516561853730" /></a><br /><br />Now I would think it fairly obvious that the typical choice would be to scale by the short sides... But this is just one instance and hence it's wise to know why a choice is made..<br /><br />Let's take a look at 35mm to Large Format conversion.. firstly here is the 35mm picture taken with  a 35mm lens...<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9HbGuPEnXI/AAAAAAAAAYI/oeHyRUMRUxY/s1600-h/35mm.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9HbGuPEnXI/AAAAAAAAAYI/oeHyRUMRUxY/s400/35mm.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175158355362356594" /></a><br /><br /><br /> The long side ration is 36mm to 120mm which gives approx 1:3.3 which is a 116mm lens.. (nice length on 4x5) which would result in this picture<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9HbG-PEnYI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/lMwev_Y-lfw/s1600-h/ratio-of-long.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9HbG-PEnYI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/lMwev_Y-lfw/s400/ratio-of-long.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175158359657323906" /></a><br /><br />If we use the short sides, we get a ratio of 95mm to 24mm which gives approx 3.96:1 which gives a 138mm lens.. <br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9HbG-PEnZI/AAAAAAAAAYY/HHW5UOyEBco/s1600-h/ratio-of-short.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9HbG-PEnZI/AAAAAAAAAYY/HHW5UOyEBco/s400/ratio-of-short.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175158359657323922" /></a><br /><br />Using the diagonal gives a ratio of 3.5 to 1 which gives 122mm lens.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9HbHePEnaI/AAAAAAAAAYg/ItUgTY_1XCM/s1600-h/ratio-of-diagonl.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9HbHePEnaI/AAAAAAAAAYg/ItUgTY_1XCM/s400/ratio-of-diagonl.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5175158368247258530" /></a><br /><br /><br />Which of these makes sense.... Well <br /><br />1) if you are used to cropping your pictures already, the short edge comparison recreates this. 1:3.96 (~4:1)<br /><br />2) if you like to get a lot of forground and background in portrait mode, then you'll want to get the comparison of the long side. 1:3.33<br /><br />3) if like the amount your current lenses encompass width ways (on a landscape orientation shot), you should use the long side conversion. 1:3.33

</h3>
<div class='post-header-line-1'></div>
<div class='post-body entry-content'>
Velvia 50 is a favourite film of landscape photographers worldwide, so much so that when Fuji shut down production because of materials issues (the Velvia was on it's own dedicated line using difficult to source materials according to Fuji), the uproar was enormous. People stocked refrigerators full of the stuff. When the head of Fuji was at a large gallery exhibition and asked what films were being used and he was answered "Every one of these pictures if using Fuji Velvia, the one we've just shut down the plant for"... or so the probably apocryphal story goes. Whatever happened, Fuji pulled all the stops out and created a new version of the film using the new common production plants. The film is that popular that there are lots of photoshop plugins and extensions just to replicate it (probably the only film that has software specifically named after it). <br /><br />Why do landscape photographers love this film so much though? It's not realistic at all, the colours are  lot more saturated than in real life so you would imagine people who love the land would want to represent it as it actualy is. Some photographers hate Velvia, it's true, and it can certainly look horribly overcooked in the wrong conditions. There is something about a scene taken using Velvia that is just more 'natural' .. more how we remember it. <br /><br />So let's do some research (I'll do it for you) into how we understand colour and saturation. Firstly, we don't actually remember colour - we aren't wired up to be able to do this. We remember symbols for colour. For instance, if I show you an golden delicious apple, you see it and then your brain remembers 'normal looking green apple' not R 81% G 75% B 17%. When you try to recollect the colour, your brain goes normal looking green apple and pulls out it's memory of what a normal looking green apple should look like. This is typically more saturated than the actual time really was. The brain also plays all sorts of tricks with these colour memories. The image below shows my guess at what a golden delicious colour is combined with the results of two photographs taken from google images and a painting of a bowl of golden delicious apples. My guess is the most saturated of them but it's interesting that the painting is the second most saturated.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9BA7FzkKZI/AAAAAAAAAXA/JdA4ANCAbLU/s1600-h/color-model.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R9BA7FzkKZI/AAAAAAAAAXA/JdA4ANCAbLU/s400/color-model.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5174707355763616146" /></a><br />This increase in saturation is common in a lot of paintings - at least if we filter by the time period that had access to the full colour spectrum of oils/acrylics/etc - a lot of old oil paintings have not only faded but they didn't have all of the colours we take for granted now. Looking at 19th century landscape art is probably a good example. Yes there are artists who have tried to carry on using the 'old masters' aesthetic, but more common is to see this 'idealisation' of colour. <br /><br />Research has been carried out that supports this also, the following links are just a few samples.<br /><br />Choosing highest saturation for color name<br />http://www.humboldt1.com/~cr2/colors.htm<br /><br />Article About Memory Color<br />http://www.isisimaging.com/MemoryColorPaper.pdf<br /><br />Accuracy of Hue and Saturation recall<br />http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=v96l1008<br /><br />The main research I remember I can't find a reference to at the moment but the study showed people an abstract chip of colour. They were asked to memorise it. They then were asked to pick that colour from a selection of different hues and saturations. Quite soon after the event, the people were fairly accurate. After a day, the participants chose a slightly more saturated colour. After a few days, they chose a more saturated colour that tended toward the nearest primary colour. <br /><br />So is Velvia actually a better representation of how we remember things? If I have experienced the lakes on a beautiful spring day with pinky purple sunset and then a year later see a photo of that event on Fuji Sensia and another picture on Fuji Velvia, which one will be most like my memory of that event? <br /><br />Another idea is that we as photographers develop an eye for colour that perceives and remembers colours that are in real life quite muted. It's these perceived colours that we want to show to the outside world, not the actual colours that were really there...<br /><br />Discuss....

<div class='post-body entry-content'>
The subject of lens equivalents has come up on Large Format Photography mailing list recently and I thought it a good time to come up with the definitive answer to the 35mm to large format (4x5) ratio. <br /><br />The first thing was to make sure we really know the size of a large format and a 35mm photography. Well I thought this would be easy but there was a surprise in store. The 35mm size was not 35mm (but I think I knew this). The size was actually 36mm x 24m (35mm was the size of the width of the film strip).<br /><br />You would expect large format film to be 4" x 5" but actually it's not this, it's 3.74"x4.72" (or 95mm x 120mm). This means the aspect ratio is actually 1:1.26 and you lose over 10% of the film area you thought you had :-(<br /><br />So... the ratio between LF and 35mm can be calculated based on three things. The first  is comparing by short dimension. This is the method I use as I used to crop my 35mm pictures to 4x5 and I now use a mask. This preserves the short dimension of the 35mm picture size and doing this gives a ratio of 3.96 to 1.<br /><br />The second way to calculate the ratio is presuming that if you like the amount of landscape you can include with your 35mm camera, you should use the long dimension as  as the ratio. i.e. if you decide you want to take a landscape orientation picture and you stand in front of Buachaille Etive Mor and want to get the whole mountain in, then you'll want to get the whole mountain in with 4x5 too.. So you'll need the longer side of the aspect ratio to convert properly. This gives a ratio of 3.33 to 1.<br /><br />The ratio that most people use however is the diagonal. I haven't seen a single justification for this apart from "It uses bits of the short and bits of the long dimension". Anyway, this gives, 3.54 to 1, which is probably the ratio a lot of people recognise.<br /><br />In summary: -<br /><br />short dimension comparison gives ~ 4 : 1<br />long dimension comparison gives ~ 3.33 : 1 <br />diagonal dimension comparison gives ~ 3.5 : 1<br /><br />Whilst I was doing this I also used google docs spreadsheet program to calculate a few more things, like what lens distribution would you get it you use 40% spacing of focal length and worked from a 150mm lens? What ratios do Leica and Nikon recommend (based on a posting at LFP.info)? What happens if you use 40% difference in angles instead?<br /><br />Visit <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p9VlogmKEIcZHFDoKQluQSA">this google spreadsheet</a> to see my calculations.. If you want a copy of the spreadsheet just ask or I think you may be able to copy it from the google site.<br /><br />I should say that the common consensus seems to be to choose your lenses so that the spacing is approximately 40% by focal length. If you want to carry less lenses, use 50%. <br /><br />As an example from my spreadsheet. If we start with 150 and 210 as a couple of focal lengths that have a lot of common lenses in, we get the 40% ratio and the extrapolated focal lengths in this range would be 77, 107, 150, 210, 294, 412 or if we map to real lenses this would be 75, 110, 150, 210, 300, 400.<br /><br />I chose to use slightly longer spacing at the top end and slightly shorter spacing at the bottom end. Thinking about this since, I think it might be more useful to have closer spacing at the top end. The reason is that most uses of longer lenses are to pick out details at a distance and it's harder to 'use your feet' when you are working in a 3D environment, for instance if you are on the side of a hill looking down a valley, moving 30% closer to the other side of the valley changes your viewpoint somewhat. My lenses are 80, 110, 150, 240, 360, 500 which give ratios of 40%, 40%, 60%, 50%, 40%. The gap between 150 and 240 is a bit long, I could do with a 190 or 200 to plug the gap but my pack is heavy enough as it is :-)<br /><br />Joe Cornish uses (from the first light book) 58, 72, 90, 120, 150, 210, 300 (although I doubt he uses all of them at once!) which gives 25%, 25%, 33%, 25%, 40%, 43%. The steps are longer at the top end which is probably because these lengths are used a lot less frequently by Joe (although by his own admission he rarely takes out the 58).

I've said in a previous post that I use my Canon 5D as a finder for my Ebony 45SU. Before now I've used an approx guess at 4x the difference in focal lengths in order to choose my lens. Today I tried out converting these  settings by eye, trying the large format lens and then finding out the focal length that would be the equivalent in 35mm.  <br /><br />So the conversions I found were (based on a focus point of approx 4m )<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R8rMruH77HI/AAAAAAAAAW0/RsHa7UJ81ME/s1600-h/24105.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R8rMruH77HI/AAAAAAAAAW0/RsHa7UJ81ME/s400/24105.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5173172173476195442" /></a><br /><br />The 80mm lens can be checked by using with long dimension of a <a href="2007/08/metering-with-digital-slr.html">4x5 cropped</a> 5D viewfinder to check the short dimension of the 80mm..<br /><br />I'll have to try infinity focus equivalents next.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Addendum: </span>Infinity focus tested - results updated in image

<div class='post-body entry-content'>
As a follow on from <a href="2008/02/lens-hoods-and-filters.html">Lens Hoods and Filters</a>, I received a standard hood (one slot) from Lee yesterday and tried it out with my various lenses when mounted on a 2 slot holder with tandem adapter as long as you don't extend it fully (extension of about 12-15cm). All of the other lenses (240, 360, 500) work fine with any amount of filters and at full extension.<br /><br />As far as polarising filters go, you can pull the standard hood to full extension, drop the filter (not mounted on ring) into the front of the hood so it nestles in the last but one fold of the hood and then close down the hood a little. This holds the polariser safely and work with the 150mm lens.<br /><br />The standard hood comes with front slots but be warned that they cannot be used for normal filters. They are a bit wider (115cm) and so can only be used with custom made filters/masks. I tried a custom mask for my 360 which had a 2x3 inch(ish) hole in it but slotted into the holder. Whether this level of masking is really necessary is questionable. I shall have to do some more experiments.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">extra:</span> I found an article that seems to suggest that my idea of masks to limit the image circle to only that necessary for the picture may have some merit.

The responses I got were varied but most people agreed that if you want real detail, you want to be +1 2/3 to 2 stops above and if you want shadow detail you want to be -2 stops.<br /><br />However, the feedback I got from Joe Cornish was that it really is a long subject which needs more than a quick response but in short, Velvia 50 responds well to reds and yellows and not so well to blues and cyans. This means that when you take a shot into the sun, you can get texture up to +2 1/2 and colour up towards +2 2/3 to +3 .. Cyan and Blue however start to go clear at +2 1/3 and if you want texture, you need to be using  +1 2/3.. Wow! Something I think will be very useful. At the bottom end, the feedback is that Velvia will record black detail down to -2 2/3 (although you need a drum scanner to get it out) and -3 will go hard black. <br /><br />I've modified my sticker accordingly but will try to have a longer conversation about this in the future. In the meantime, if anybody would like one, I've printed off a few extra if someone wants to send a stamped addressed envelope to Tim Parkin, 237 Lidgett Lane, Leeds LS17 6QR; I'll send a couple back.

(see diagram below for the amount of extra light your camera receives - format of image plagiarised from Schneider docs)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R8b781b8PGI/AAAAAAAAAWg/nG-xopvMslg/s1600-h/imagecircles.gif"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R8b781b8PGI/AAAAAAAAAWg/nG-xopvMslg/s400/imagecircles.gif" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172098244636589154" /></a><br />Lee offer three different hood options. The wide angle hood, the universal hood and the standard hood. I bought a wide angle hood off ebay for a good price so this is the first I am working with.  (By the way, thanks to Tre at Robert White for measuring the hood sizes)<br /><br />This hood will only really work with the 80 and 110 lenses so my criteria are:<br /><br />1) 80mm + centre filter + alignable grad + warming + polariser + hood.<br /><br />The first 2 items mean using a push on filter with a 100mm hole and a 100-90 bushing. This is fine. I add two slots to this and use a tandem adapter to mount the wide angle hood (configured with one slot). Bad news... This vignettes in the corners. Now I have mounted a polariser ring on the inside of the wide angle hood (it was a good fit) but this doesn't seem to make the problem much worse.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R8YBkVb8PDI/AAAAAAAAAWI/6sdtGCQ-jOI/s1600-h/overview2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R8YBkVb8PDI/AAAAAAAAAWI/6sdtGCQ-jOI/s400/overview2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171822945822850098" /></a><br />Just as an experiment, I tried using 1 filter holder on the push on and attached it to the lenshood with blue tack. This works a treat even with the polariser mounted (although I'm getting very small corner crops which I think are curable by using a slimline polariser (I'm using the Lee 105 polariser at the moment which is very thick).<br /><br />I've ordered a bunch of very powerful 1mm thick magnets which should allow me to mount filter holders very close to each other and at about 30 degree intervals (enough for most very wide work I imagine). We'll see where this leads. <br /><br />2) 110mm with/without centre filter. The above solutions works a treat with the standard layout. <br /><br />3) 150mm lens. This should be fine with the WA Hood but would be better with the standard hood. (see diagram at the top of the page)<br /><br />4) 240/360/500 - I think that these would be best accomodated by adding masks to the front mount of the standard hood.<br /><br /><br />The main problem then is solving the 80mm lens issue. If I can manage a solution for this, then the rest of the lens fit niceley. Lets hope some magnetronic jiggery pokery works.

I also wanted to try out some new gear I've acquired, namely a Gitzo tripod and a Pentax Digital Spotmeter (with my V50-Zone mod).<br /><br />We arrived at about 2.30pm and with a little bit of out of fitness huffing and puffing we got to the top and looked around. There are only a few trees around the top (a lot less than you'd think given that nearly every picture up here has one or more in) so it's lone tree syndrome by default I'm afraid. There is, however, a fantastic variety of limestone pavement, ranging from very flat planes to sharp clints and deep grikes (clints being the solid bits and grikes being the gaps).<br /><br />A very niceley positioned tree gave me the opportunity to compose limestone foreground with a rounded edge into the tree and then Ingleton peak in the background. Unfortunately the lighting only really left black and white as an option. One to come back for though. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7gwfFb8O3I/AAAAAAAAAUo/wyt3ZNKVtQE/s1600-h/IMG_62351.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7gwfFb8O3I/AAAAAAAAAUo/wyt3ZNKVtQE/s400/IMG_62351.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5167933883001092978" /></a><br /><br /><br />As we walked further over the top of Twistleton, the sun started setting and a wonderful golden glow highlighted the tops of the clints. In one particular section, the clients were rounded and shaped like lobes of a brain or coral reefs. This became the picture you see above. I did take a large format shot but the sun was dropping so fast that I think I missed getting the golden highlights. The Spotmeter was wonderful to use and the V50-Zone sticker made working out exposure a lot easier. <br /><br />The new tripod is definitely a lot more stable than my old Velbon but the steel spikes have one disadvantage (although it might be an advantage in disguise). It is more difficult to position the legs with the spikes fitted because of you don't have the spike at right angles (or with 10 or 20 degrees of a right angle) to the rock it's resting on, it does stand a chance of slipping. So getting a sturdy position for the tripod takes a moment longer. However, I have the feeling that the 'stickiness' of the rubber feet has been hiding precarious tripod leg placement. The rubber, if positioned improperly, is probably slipping slowly; wheras with the spike, this slipping is obvious. I'll have to carry on checking this. The extra length of the legs came in useful pretty much immediatly. I wanted to stand on a rock to get some height but there were no places equally high to place the legs; in the past I would have given up but the shot was simple with the extra extension.

My main complaint about the Sekonic is that it doesn't make it easy to use the zone system and to check relative exposures. Pretty much every large format photographer of note tends to use the Pentax Digital Spotmeter (PDS) or some equivalent (e.g. a simple EV meter with a mechanical calculator). <br /><br />The advantage of the mechanical calculator on the PDS is that it makes it simple to look up alternative exposure settings. It's also very easy to apply offsets.<br /><br />The only missing part of the equation is using the zone system (if you can't find a neutral grey, you can't use the default exposure reading). There is a sticker made by Zone VI which shows all of the zone levels from 1 to 9. However this only really works for high range black and white film with a dynamic range of 8 or 9 stops. (The picture below is from a review of the Zone VI mod at <a href="http://www.butzi.net/reviews/light_meters.htm">http://www.butzi.net/reviews/light_meters.htm</a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7g9Clb8O8I/AAAAAAAAAVQ/9lZw0se64_U/s1600-h/ps1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7g9Clb8O8I/AAAAAAAAAVQ/9lZw0se64_U/s400/ps1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5167947687025982402" /></a><br /><br /><br />With Velvia 50, you only really have 5 stops of range, which with a bit of research I'm presuming is +2.3 to -2.7. So what is a person to do? Make my own that's what! So I made up a template using Macromedia Fireworks (after measuring the width of a stop on the meter and the depth of space I could use). The following is a jpg you can use to print out if you like).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7hAl1b8O_I/AAAAAAAAAVo/d8-8ZWRkaQ8/s1600-h/VELVIA-ZONE-PENTAX-400.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7hAl1b8O_I/AAAAAAAAAVo/d8-8ZWRkaQ8/s400/VELVIA-ZONE-PENTAX-400.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5167951591151254514" /></a><br /><br />Once this was made up I printed it out on stickyback paper and then covered the top with a strong, clear sellotape (for water and smudge resistance). Clipping off the corners to try to stop it getting knocked off and it all seems to be OK.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7g9hFb8O-I/AAAAAAAAAVg/VsJWaMQvo9I/s1600-h/pentax-spotmeter-velviazone-zoom.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7g9hFb8O-I/AAAAAAAAAVg/VsJWaMQvo9I/s400/pentax-spotmeter-velviazone-zoom.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5167948211011992546" /></a><br /><br />The idea is that you find a part of the scene you want to be a certain zone and take a measurement from it. Then place that EV reading against the zone on the sticker.<br /><br />NB: I should add that the in the photo above, the scale isn't centred on 8 and hence it looks like zone XI is 2 2/3 rather than the 2 1/3 I intended it to be.. I should also add that I'm not 100% sure that 2 1/3 isn't totally transparent (I've got a feeling it probably is - or rather even if it's not, if you read 2 1/3 with a light meter and there is any texture, the highlights will be above 2 1/3 and hence totally transparent)

The sand was even higher again than last time, probably by about 30cm. You can see from the small pictures below the difference on one section (which wasn't the worst). The weekend was also gloriously sunny, which isn't good news for daytime shooting, but was loveley for just wandering around (I even think I got a little sunstroke!)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R699PFb8OvI/AAAAAAAAATo/I8NwaD5eRpU/s1600-h/levels.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R699PFb8OvI/AAAAAAAAATo/I8NwaD5eRpU/s400/levels.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165484995728128754" /></a><br /><br />On the saturday we wandered around the beach a little but then decamped to Saltwick Bay which was extraordinary! Between finding ammonites and remains of alum mining, we were also admiring the red sands and the amazing coloured conglomerate rocks. The minerals around this part of the coast have imparted incredible variety of colour into the the boulders, cliffs and bedding. I can understand why this is a mecca for geologists (and photographers!).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7BZ-Vb8O2I/AAAAAAAAAUg/P2ogtB7fqVc/s1600-h/IMG_61881.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7BZ-Vb8O2I/AAAAAAAAAUg/P2ogtB7fqVc/s400/IMG_61881.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165727700035058530" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R6998Fb8OxI/AAAAAAAAAT4/P4I0gfB-FO0/s1600-h/IMG_61901.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R6998Fb8OxI/AAAAAAAAAT4/P4I0gfB-FO0/s400/IMG_61901.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165485768822242066" /></a><br /><br />We finished the day off over towards the moors at fen bog with a glorious display of evening colour made all the more intense by the bracken fires that were burning (managed fires I think). I got to use my 360 for the first time, picking off a detail of trees and shrubs against a blue and pink sky. I'd been led to believe that the 360 was difficult to get tilt focus working well but I had no problem at all with it.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R6998lb8OyI/AAAAAAAAAUA/IBEeN05hIEw/s1600-h/IMG_61951.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R6998lb8OyI/AAAAAAAAAUA/IBEeN05hIEw/s400/IMG_61951.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165485777412176674" /></a><br /><br /><br />I tried a couple of polaroid shots too, one at Saltwick and one at Fen Bog but both were a little unsatisfying. I'm coming to the conclusion that the type 79 effect is an acquired taste and probably only good for certain subjects. This is probably quite good as Polaroid have just cancelled production of all instant films.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R69981b8OzI/AAAAAAAAAUI/rGzHXPAaX4o/s1600-h/IMG_62041.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R69981b8OzI/AAAAAAAAAUI/rGzHXPAaX4o/s400/IMG_62041.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165485781707143986" /></a><br /><br />The Sunday finished the weekend with a trip to the beach again to see if the sand levels had changed. Alas not but the colour in the sky was very pretty and fun was had trying to find detail shots with the minimum of material. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R6999Fb8O0I/AAAAAAAAAUQ/7knxSxqvuVw/s1600-h/IMG_62231.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R6999Fb8O0I/AAAAAAAAAUQ/7knxSxqvuVw/s400/IMG_62231.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165485786002111298" /></a><br /><br />One incident still amazes me; whilst I was taking a shot of the shoreline, a dog walker walked towards me (out of his direct way) and then straight in front of my shot, walking all of the clean sand.. He apologised just afterward, saying "Oh I'm sorry was that in your shot?".. I'd have thought he was just a bit dim if he hadn't then done exactly the same thing to Mel another 100 yards down the beach. Some people seem to take a perverse pleasure in this sort of baiting. Very strange.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R6999Vb8O1I/AAAAAAAAAUY/c6IKsddzlEE/s1600-h/IMG_6211-Edit1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R6999Vb8O1I/AAAAAAAAAUY/c6IKsddzlEE/s400/IMG_6211-Edit1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165485790297078610" /></a>

There is no date on it, no exposure data, no camera settings, no lens information, etc. Film photographers have to record all this information for themselves. Large format photographers do not even get the order in which the photographs were taken (sometimes a strip of 35mm can put the information on each exposure in context). So what we do is to make notes. <br /><br />I tried making notes freehand to begin with but it was such a mess. I can't write particularly well at the best of times and I'd always forget something. Also, I wanted something that could help me make sure I'd checked everything before taking each exposure. <br /><br />The result is my exposure checklist that I've printed out and made into a little clipboard that slips into my Gnass Quickload Pouch. When I take photograph I fill in the details and mark an incrementing number on each quickload. The result is almost organised and it's stopped me making mistakes a few times.. <br /><br />I also try to make a quick sketch of the scene and mark down some of the important EV readings. In this way I can then double check the exposure of critical shots when I get back to base. I can look at the digital version as well, checking that the result will look correct and judging how blown out highlight or blocked up shadows will be before sending off the first sheet.. <br /><br />I'm off to Whitby this weekend so I'll show a sample exposure sheet with my notes. I'm also looking forward to trying out my new tripod. I don't know if I've mentioned but I've worked with surveying equipment in a previous life and the use of spikes for the tripods seems to be a given. If this sort of critical task benefits from spikes then I thought photography might benefit too so my new Gitzo 3540XLS has 4 inch stainless steel spikes (which I can swap with rubber feet if needed indoors). The tripod is also bloody huge. At it's maximum height with the feet on, I can't attach my Ebony as the ceiling gets in the way!!  This sounds like overkill, and on flat land it probably is (although Charlie Waite might disagree); on a sloping hill though, you need two very long legs to use on the downward side and if you are on the uphill side you can still  only just stand up.. It's less than a pound heavier than my current setup and I'd prefer the extra weight to be on the tripod where it can do some good..<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7hP8Fb8PAI/AAAAAAAAAVw/nHakP_mM4t0/s1600-h/45du-on-gitzo.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7hP8Fb8PAI/AAAAAAAAAVw/nHakP_mM4t0/s400/45du-on-gitzo.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5167968466077760514" /></a><br /><br />The odd thing about the Gitzo is that it smells of old ladies bathing products. A fragrant talc smell that fortunately wears off fairly quickly. Somewhat disturbing though!

I was playing around with the polaroid a little more this weekend with a flower photo and two family photos. The flower was taken under tungsten and was insistently yellow. The two portraits were taken indoors but with natural lighting. The exposures were in the 1/40 second range and the temperature was average indoor.. The colour of the exposures was still yellowy. I'm going to try taking some shots in daylight (possibly shaded) to see how they turn out. I have the feeling the naturally cool daylight will balance the naturally yellow polaroid.. We'll see.

Whilst taking photographs in Whitby recently, the conditions were very wet. Not only was it raining but the humidity was really high. All of this meant that my ground glass was getting covered in condensation (as evidenced by the main picture!) at one point, however, I started to get worried that the my ground glass was broken. The bottom left corner of it was completely black. Once I'd figured out it was water (by looking at the corner from an angle as the water had made the ground glass completely transparent) I then wondered if it would do any permanent damage.<br /><br />Fortunately I was reassured by a friend (thanks Mel) that you can unscrew the back of the glass and let the fresnel and glass dry out (don't rub the fresnel if you can help it though, let it air dry). So there you go...

I wanted to try out my new Polaroid back and type 79 film (colour 4x5) and also the new 360/500. <br /><br />We went up to the Roaches, just past Leek, but the wind at the top was horrific and combined with the dense heather (tripod legs can't get through to the ground) it was like taking a photograph on a bouncy castle. We retreated back towards lake Tittesworth and stopped at the foot of Hen Cloud just as the sun started descending. The whole of the sky was mostly overcast, dense cloud but there was a streak of clear on the horizon.<br /><br />As soon as the sun struck this streak of clear we started shooting. The problem was that the band of light wasn't lighting up the land and so we ended up using 5 stops of ND grad just to control the sun. This revealed the slight magenta colour cast of the Lee filters which was a little annoying. It also highlighted the need for a reverse grad (see the <a href="http://www.singh-ray.com/reversegrads.html">Singh Ray</a> site for an explanation). I'll possibly try out a singh ray 4 stop grad and 2 stop reverse grad at some point in the future. <br /><br />The composition was satisfying though, but it needs a little work (dodge the top clouds, get rid of the flare spot at the bottom left).<br /><br />I did take a Polaroid of this shot too. The dynamic range of the type 79 seems to be very close to Velvia (although it's a 100asa). The colours are very yellowy though, almost like a old master - think constable effect. Working with Polaroid is mucky though (lots of ick everywhere - make sure you have a plastic bag for the crap and a safe place to put your pictures while they dry off - otherwise they'll end up with a matt finish).<br /><br /><br />I didn't manage to take proper large format shot (too much wind still) but did try out the 360 just to check how it focused in the field (very well).

I've also been developing David's website and so have been working closely with his images for some time. I imagine this can't help but have an influence, even sub-consciously. An example  of this influence would be the photograph of the dead tree on Rannoch Moor that I've recently uploaded to Flickr. <br /><br />This photograph was taken without once thinking about David's own iconic picture (which I believe will grace the front of his new book) and it's also not a patch on David's picture (the snow on the mountains, the beautiful fluffy clouds, the strong leading line through use of wide angle). In this location however, I believe there are only a few different obvious and strong 'vista' shots. The location of the stream and the fact that the background is strongest in this direction plus the boulders and plants, both adding detail and colour. Finally, the views in the other directions just aren't as interesting. The main thing I don't like about David's shot is the blocky scan of it I've seen (the amazon cover doesn't look much better at the minute).<br /><br />Then again this isn't a particularly David Ward picture in my opinion. The picture that Charles mentions is a lot more reminiscent of the types of picture that I identify David with. It has strong graphic lines and shapes, it makes good use of texture, it 'connotes more than it denotes' (in this case I'd hope to say something about flow and time). But, again, I wasn't thinking about David Ward when I was taking this. If anything, I was thinking about Nigel Halliwell and Mel Foster, both of whom who know David and are probably inspired by him. Does this mean I'm inspired y David second hand in this case.<br /><br />But what about the photographers who inspired David? Do David's pictures look David Ward-ish or is there some photographer out there with whom David has a strong link. People talk about a "Joe Cornish" look but they fail to see through Joe through to his influences (Peter Dombrovskis, Eliot Porter, Michael Fatali). <br /><br />I believe we have in britain a zeitgeist embodied by certain high profile photographers. This has led to an easy (and lazy) categorisation of anything without a horizon as being Ward-ish, anything rustic (and square) as being Waite-ish, anything Vista-ish with strong near-far compositions as being Cornish-ish. <br /><br />It is difficult as there aren't many books tracing the history of Landscape photography through it's influences and people like Eliot Porter get missed completely by a lot of people (my included). <br /><br />In hindsight, we can see a photographers body of work and understand a 'style' as being implicit in everything they did. But if you ask that photographer about their artwork, they will show you picture after picture that denies that style; pictures that demonstrate a talent far away from the charicature developed in the media. <br /><br />Now how difficult is it for me to have a developed style and to demonstrate it in a single picture. <br /><br />I ask you to look at the following pictures and tell me if they fit their photographers charicature..<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.joecornish.com/global/images/uploads/20060420164609.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.joecornish.com/global/images/uploads/20060420164609.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/86/mainImage?size=600x632&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/86/mainImage?size=600x632&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.charliewaite.com/images/2380.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.charliewaite.com/images/2380.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />You can identify the original photographer by their aspect ratio if you like - does this mean that these photographers style's are so closely linked with something as trivial as picture shape?<br /><br />Because I've realised that the only way to really let my style show through is to work on a limited body of subject matter until I've exhausted sub-conscious influence and have to start thinking myself about composition, style, topic, etc. In other words, entering a gestalt state of perception and then working back to my visual metaphors (probably having to create them on the way back).<br /><br />Charles also asks a few other questions:-<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Do you feel it is your duty or plainly unavoidable to make pictures that someone else (eg David Ward) might have made? </span><br /><br />It's totally unavoidable that I might make pictures that someone else might have made.  It's less likely that this will happen if I have built my own 'recipe' for a photograph to taste nice to me. This recipe might well contain ingredients from other photographers (who may have inherited these ingredients from still other photographers. Some ingredients I will find myself along the way. <br /><br />I wonder if David Ward worried about this photograph being 'Sugimoto-ish' (or even 'Gustav Le Gray-ish')<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/74/mainImage?size=600x632&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=60"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.into-the-light.com/system/ecommerce/74/mainImage?size=600x632&amp;sharpen=1.0x0.5%2b0.8%2b0.1&amp;quality=600" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Charles also asks a few final questions: -<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Do you feel that your originality lies in the fact that you are the one who has found this material? In other words, do you think that the location will give greater originality than the rendition? </span><br /><br />No but I do believe that working around an original location will more likely allow you to express what your style is rather than being pushed around by the weight of previous photographic incarnations (e.g. I've been to Lochan N-Ha'Achlaise three times but each time I've tried to avoid the cliche compositions). Then again, you could say that if you go to a famous place, you really have to use your own skill and style to create a picture that avoids saying what has already been said... I'm not averse to the rare or popular location as long as it has material that will allow me to be creative in.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Do you feel that the aim of your quest is to find the material that will allow you to express a particular style, or do you feel that the aim of your quest is to find the material that chimes with something inside you and then to represent it according to a style which suits it and your feelings towards it (a style which you effectively pull out of a catalogue)?</span><br /><br />The aim of my quest is to create a consistent body of work rather than a 'grab bag' of opportunistic photographs. I don't want to collect pictures of famous locations (which seems to be a common photography hobby). It's great to go to a location that you've seen in print and it's exciting if you can create something original from this. It's also great to strike off on your own to find new grounds. I'm going on a Light and Land trip to the Gower peninsula soon at which we'll visit very commonly photographed locations and I'm sure I'll capture shots that are very reminiscent of other photographers. I also hope I'll capture some pictures that present my transcription of those locales..

Well it was but was still finding myself using the 24-105 as a finder and spotting shots at the top end (equivelent of 300-420mm large format). I acquired a Fujinon 240A which was recommended to me by many people (and seen online in the excellent <a href="http://www.thalmann.com/largeformat/future.htm">Future Classics</a> by Kerry Thalmann in which he reviews many modern lenses, some of which are now discontinued. One of the discontinued lenses that repeatedly gets attention, and more importantly that would work perfectly on my Ebony 45SU is the Nikkor 360 T-ED. This is a telephoto lens that has a Flange Focus (i.e. extension length for infinity focus) of 261mm (see the <a href="http://www.ebonycamera.com/articles/lenses.html">Lens Table</a> on the Ebony site for details). This means that I can get reasonable near focus without maximum extension (about 2m close focus).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7gw-1b8O6I/AAAAAAAAAVA/sI7iCRhCFtM/s1600-h/IMG_62551.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7gw-1b8O6I/AAAAAAAAAVA/sI7iCRhCFtM/s400/IMG_62551.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5167934428461939618" /></a><br /><br />The 360 can also be adapted to a 500 with the replacement of the rear element. Even better for me, the rear element can be focused as close as 10m with the range of extension available on the Ebony. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7gw_Fb8O7I/AAAAAAAAAVI/Ul995NU7BPI/s1600-h/IMG_62561.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R7gw_Fb8O7I/AAAAAAAAAVI/Ul995NU7BPI/s400/IMG_62561.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5167934432756906930" /></a><br /><br /><br />The bad news is that they don't come up for sale very often (especially not with the rear element). The good news is that one came up for sale on Ebay America for a reasonable price and I won the bid! The lens is in mint condition and although is f8/f11, is OK to focus in reasonable light.<br /><br />I'll be trying the lens out for the first time this weekend so it should be interesting. I think I'll have to stop now as my bag is getting a bit heavy (although a super trekker does sound appealing - I'll have to try David's out next time I see him).

I've not talked much about the camera I'm using much recently so I thought I'd rectify that. At the moment, I take two cameras out to with me whenever I'm out, a Canon 5D which is modified to feel like a 4x5 rather than 3x2 (i.e. it has a custom mask over the prism and black masks over the LCD display) and uses a 24-105 lens (equivalent to a 96mm to 420mm large format lenses). This camera is used as a scouting and framing tool and also to get captures that I'm uncertain are worth spending &#163;7 per shot. I still take care making sure these photographs are sharp and usable though. <br /><br />If the shot is looking good, then the Ebony 45SU comes out. I am so happy with the Ebony 45SU that I have been forgiving it a couple of small foibles. Firstly the focusing rails can be a bit stiff. This exhibits itself worst when first racking out the front standard. When the standard is reaching full extension, it loosens off somewhat. The rear standard is stiff but not unacceptably so.<br /><br />After looking around a few forums and asking a friend, Gerry Gavigan, about it; it turns out you can adjust the screws along the two plates that hold the rails down. I would strongly advise getting a good quality 0pt Pozidrive screwdriver so that you don't damage the screw heads. I loosened off the screws that were closest to the front standard by about half a turn and everything got a lot better. There is a balance to be had however in that if you loosen it to an acceptable tightness when you are starting to open it, then it will be a little loose at full extension (which is when you need the rigidity most). <br /><br />I would recommend a tension whereby you need to grip hard to start turning moving the standard which will mean that the tension is still grippy when fully extended (you don't want the standards moving if you push against them for instance).<br /><br />The other balance is that loosening the tension affects both front and back standards equally (at least when adjusting the 'starting' tension). It's all a balancing act but I would be very careful not to rotate the screws more than half a turn. It might be a good idea to mark the 'home' rotation on the screw head and if you aren't moveing more than half a turnlooser or quarter of a turn tighter you can always check to see how much each screw has been moved.<br /><br />The other adjustment I've made to the Ebony is to add markings against the front and back standads so I can see how much rise/fall I've applied and also marked the inside of the backstandard to show rotation angle (at least for back tilt and for non-shifted swing).<br /><br />Using the Canon 5D and Ebony 45SU together like this does mean significant extra weight but I feel it's very useful for me to understand framing and perspective.. It also gives me more freedom to fine tune composition and tripod position so that when the Ebony is on the tripod, I only need to make small movements.<br /><br />One of the tricks with a large format camera is to set up your picture and then fine tune the composition by using rise/fall and shift. This allows you to move up to 50% in each direction (with the right lens) and not to have to refocus or change the relative position of anything in the frame...<br /><br />I'll try to add a picture of the screw layout sometime soon

Unfortunately that blasted horizon cloud made an appearance and the sun sank without a trace. Sutton bank was sort of interesting; I imagine the view is stunning in clear weather or with a slight haze and a good sunset, but it's not the most inspiring of locations to try to find strong compositions in. I think I might be getting addicted to foreground; the though of having nothing in the picture closer than  100ft disturbs me for some reason.<br /><br />Anyway, this weekend me and Charlotte went to Almscliffe Crag (a Yorkshire gritstone outcrop near Harrogate) in another attempt to catch the sun (rising this time) same news again though, although the cloud had moved over to the east this time..<br /><br />So Yesterday I went out to Whitby to catch some geology, figuring the weather can't ruin that for me.. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5U2M6UR2QI/AAAAAAAAARw/apC2HHznHQ0/s1600-h/IMG_60821.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5U2M6UR2QI/AAAAAAAAARw/apC2HHznHQ0/s400/IMG_60821.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5158088543663413506" /></a><br /><br />Fortunately I was mostly right - although the rain did slow it down in places, holding an umbrella and using a large format camera don't mix!<br /><br />The surprise for me was that the sand was particularly high - probably a good 8inches or so higher than last time and over a foot and a half higher than when I first went. The surprise was heightened by the way that this totally changed the nature of the beach. The top of the beach now became very interesting; whereas before it was just a mess, now it had the sand framing it.<br /><br />This also affected how long it took the water to reach the rocks - because the beach was higher, I got nearly an extra one hour before the tide came back in.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5U2N6UR2SI/AAAAAAAAASA/QbY3eZE7tSQ/s1600-h/IMG_60741.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5U2N6UR2SI/AAAAAAAAASA/QbY3eZE7tSQ/s400/IMG_60741.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5158088560843282722" /></a><br /><br />Also the bands of colour at the top of the beach were heightened by having a sand bank in front of them (and the composition was simplified too).<br /><br />I particularly liked trying to find areas where the flow of the sand matched the flow of the layers of sandstone. The main picture was a wonderful find where the flow of layers in sandstone matched the rock that had nestled in the gap and mirrored the sand flow.<br /><br />The second picture here was an attempt to find some simplicity in the complex flow of water through the rocks and sand at the head of the beach. Not sure if I succeeded here..<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5U2QaUR2TI/AAAAAAAAASI/0Q7_zhwwsdU/s1600-h/IMG_60681.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5U2QaUR2TI/AAAAAAAAASI/0Q7_zhwwsdU/s400/IMG_60681.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5158088603792955698" /></a>

We'd chatted online and were both learning about large format and I'd expressed an interest in seeing the peaks and also in having a 'hunt' together. <br /><br />The day turned out pretty dire (nearly non stop rain) but the location was great (near Padley Gorge I think - I should find out really). I was particularly enamoured of the silver birch forests that had grown back over what was once quarry land. <br /><br />We stopped in the middle of an oak forest and in between chatting about cameras, photography, philosophy, websites, design, etc. We even managed to take a couple of shots. The moss was a winner in my eyes, so lush with the rain and so many varieties (species?). The top picture was very near Dav's favourite dead tree stump and was just a rock completely covered by all sorts of bachytherms..  Getting the large format shot right was difficult because it was almost macro (0.9 bellow factor) and there was no obvious best plane of focus. In the end I went from the middle of the top of the rock to the middle of the front of the rock..<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5U57qUR2VI/AAAAAAAAASY/ccjX3U6zEbk/s1600-h/IMG_60411.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5U57qUR2VI/AAAAAAAAASY/ccjX3U6zEbk/s400/IMG_60411.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5158092645357181266" /></a><br /><br />Later we found a wall that was crumbling and covered in lichen etc. The exposures were getting a little long at 2 minutes 40 seconds (reciprocity sucks) but hopefully the picture will be OK..

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3wZSqUR2OI/AAAAAAAAARg/MMuioYWEGfc/s1600-h/IMG_60091.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3wZSqUR2OI/AAAAAAAAARg/MMuioYWEGfc/s400/IMG_60091.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5151019882192689378" /></a><br /><br />There are two main projects I want to learn through during the first part of 2008. The first is the limestone pavements of the Yorkshire dales. These abstract stone structures satisfy a few requirements: geology, the process of change an flow, a large range of small, almost architectural structures and a beautiful but forbidding location. The second is the sandstone beach at Whitby. The beach satisfies the same criterion as above but also adds actual water flow, which if handled with subtelty can add a wonderful element of dynamism to a photograph. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3wZl6UR2PI/AAAAAAAAARo/8Wq2zPEg7Xk/s1600-h/IMG_60131.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3wZl6UR2PI/AAAAAAAAARo/8Wq2zPEg7Xk/s400/IMG_60131.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5151020212905171186" /></a><br /><br />Both projects are also minimise the requirement of dramatic light, for instance I don't need to have wonderful coloured skies to show the shape of the limestone or the texture of the sandstone. This gives me the opportunity to work on a more flexible compositional level rather than questing for 'the light'. Not that good light is not needed, it's just the definition of good light changes.<br /><br />Whitby has it's own challenges though, the first I encountered was the mess that the beach gets into after people have walked their dogs and made a few sandcastles. My first trip to Whitby was at a very low tide as I didn't know where the rocks were going to be revealed. Well the rocks are at the top of the beach and the low tide meant that they had suffered weeks of bipedal and quadrapedal stress.. This trip is only the second time I've been to Whitby and I wanted to make sure I at least started with a pristine beach. However, I didn't know how high the tide had to be to clear the beach. The tide predicted (by Belfield's <a href="http://www.tideplot.force9.co.uk/">Tide Plotter</a>) for Sunday morning was 4.6m at 8.23am so we (my wife and I) decided to get to Whitby for about 8 to catch the sunrise (if there was one) and then to park up near the beach to see what level the tide was at. I was expecting the tide to be washing around the rocks where I wanted to shoot but was surprised to see the tide engulfing the small cave and completely covering the rocks I wanted to photograph. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3wZQaUR2KI/AAAAAAAAARA/iCmHZMd7dhU/s1600-h/IMG_59891.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3wZQaUR2KI/AAAAAAAAARA/iCmHZMd7dhU/s400/IMG_59891.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5151019843537983650" /></a><br /><br />I was also quite surprised to see a queue of people waiting to cross the beach even at 9am. It took until 11am until the tide was low enough to access the first lot of rocks without risk of getting water over the top of my boots when the surges came in.  According to my tide table, this means that the tide level was approx 3.5 meters at the point where the beach started to become accessible. <br /><br />At this point it was also the time when I would guess approx 60 people were queued up to walk about 15 dogs and 20 children. I did get a few photographs though. <br /><br />The other thing that varies dramatically at Whitby is the amount of sand. This may sound a little strange for people not familiar with the coast but the sea can move hundreds of tons of sand over very short periods of time. When we went to Whitby last time, the peak tide was 5.2m and amazingly the level of the sand was about 30cm less.. This lower level of sand reveals some of the cleaner and more worn sandstone layers which gives more to look at. I've yet to work out when the best time to find this lowered level of sand is but from the evidence I have so far it's during the large tidal ranges and also just after stormy weather.<br /><br />Taking the photographs shown was also aided by the use of my home made '<a href="http://www.salzgeber.at/disc/">quick disk</a>' which is a simple tool whereby you print out a page onto card and cut out a small disc and a small ruler. Place the ruler on your subject (against a rock for instance) and then measure it using your ruler on your ground glass. The scale on the ruler tells you your bellows factor.. Incredibly simple and sooo useful.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3wZR6UR2NI/AAAAAAAAARY/PPvnSv3ms4Q/s1600-h/IMG_60041.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3wZR6UR2NI/AAAAAAAAARY/PPvnSv3ms4Q/s400/IMG_60041.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5151019869307787474" /></a>

The Saturday morning was supposed to be overcast, but not raining, but the Sunday was predicted as magnificent sunshine with a scattering of clouds. <br /><br />Things looked slightly awry when I woke up on Saturday morning to one of the best coloured sunrises I've seen in a long time and so I thought I'd give the day a go and wet out at 11am to Brimham Rocks near Harrogate. Upon arriving the sky was clear with some colour but some clouds were starting to show. I found a location that I hadn't seen before and that showed some potential and setup my camera, as soon as the first photograph was taken with my SLR the clouds really rolled in. I thought about wandering around to look for other locations but I decided to change my usual approach and stuck it out for the long term, waiting for some interesting light.. How long could it take?!<br /><br />After fifteen minutes, the real rain started to come down. Thankfully, I had a large flask of coffee and a windproof ultra large umbrella. I took a shot for the record just to show what it looked like (and to see what pouring rain looked like) which appears below...<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3vrgqUR2II/AAAAAAAAAQw/9oVCeGfL_fY/s1600-h/IMG_59661.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3vrgqUR2II/AAAAAAAAAQw/9oVCeGfL_fY/s400/IMG_59661.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5150969545175980162" /></a>At this point, I could either give up or stick it out until either I got a shot or the light went (2 hours later). Two or three times I almost packed up but after just over an hour, I could see patches of light coming through. Nothing special but possibly enough to give some interest in the sky. The picture below is a black and white conversion at this point when some light crossed the foreground. <br /><br />Another half an hour (and one point where I did actually pack up and start walking back) and I finally got some light that looked OK and took the picture at the top of this peice. Unfortunately, the light levels in the foregroun were very low and despite a 2 stop hard and 2 stop soft, I still had to merge a digital shot to get this picture. I did get one large format of the last picture so we'll see what it does in due course.<br /><br />One thing I have to say is that I know the picture I have is a lot better than the one I would have grabbed at the start. Whether I would have found anything better is another matter. I'm happy that I've done the subject some justice and I also know what sort of light I want to repeat the shot .<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3vrg6UR2JI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/hkPLTGTxUiA/s1600-h/IMG_59641.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R3vrg6UR2JI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/hkPLTGTxUiA/s400/IMG_59641.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5150969549470947474" /></a>

This is just an exercise in composition (and still learning how to take LF pictures). The location I chose is one that I have been to previously near Ingleton which is in a farmers field (sorry Mr Farmer), here is the <a href="2007/07/finally-ordered.html">shot</a> from my birthday last year.<br /><br />It's a good job I wasn't going out looking for good weather as we've had nothing but near 100% fog and cloud cover for the last few days. It was also -2 degrees when I arrived and didn't warm up much either. I managed to stick out the 3 hours although at one point I'd lost feeling in my knees, the fingerless gloves came in handy too.<br /><br />The location is in the middle of classic limestone pavement country and it has a single tree growing out of the stones. All of the stones have been weathered in various ways and one of my pictures (inspired a bit by Paul Strand) was a simple abstract of this weathering. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R2Z3lOIzoRI/AAAAAAAAAPY/pLfhqqkUFGI/s1600-h/2115950594_77b9812711_b.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R2Z3lOIzoRI/AAAAAAAAAPY/pLfhqqkUFGI/s400/2115950594_77b9812711_b.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5144931105651269906" /></a><br /><br />I was mostly looking for compositions that didn't include the classic 'single item in foreground and a few leading lines' but did suggest a three dimensional depth but used bold shapes and combinations of items to create structure. The first two compositions (seen below and at the top of this post) were intended to use the bold structural shape of the left hand rock to focus attention onto the tree but also onto the other stripe of grass. I liked the way that the colour of the grass changed to browns in the background. It would have been nice to have some feature at the top left hand of the first picture as that is where my eye tends to end up. The second is a less well structured composition but I like the plant life huddle up in the crack between rocks. The plant life can be seen in the first picture hiding in the jumble of rocks.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R2Z_neIzoXI/AAAAAAAAAQI/-rzDdWNBkIE/s1600-h/IMG_5866-Edit1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R2Z_neIzoXI/AAAAAAAAAQI/-rzDdWNBkIE/s400/IMG_5866-Edit1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5144939940398997874" /></a><br /><br />The next picture was as I was looking for well shaped plant life to provide a subject for 'portrait' style shot (i.e. the plan on it's own, composition given by the shape of the plant and the rock it sits on or between). The moss was crested by a small patch of frost which made the whole a little more interesting. It was very tempting just to centre the 'droplet' of moss but I wanted to ensure that any lines in the surrounding rock didn't pull attention away. <br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R2Z_nuIzoYI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/sEu4Q5IkL7I/s1600-h/IMG_58791.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R2Z_nuIzoYI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/sEu4Q5IkL7I/s400/IMG_58791.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5144939944693965186" /></a><br /><br />The final picture's curves were the striking feature that grabbed my attention and the shapes of the lichen was a bonus. Getting the two rock shapes to nest well together and to ensure that there was enough background (the tree and stalks in the background right should be in focus in my LF shot).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R2aApOIzoaI/AAAAAAAAAQg/qsgTHl6VkpQ/s1600-h/IMG_58731.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R2aApOIzoaI/AAAAAAAAAQg/qsgTHl6VkpQ/s400/IMG_58731.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5144941069975396770" /></a><br /><br />Overall the exercise was enjoyable but I would have loved to have had better modeling light and at last some cloud structure with gaps so that I could play with shading of foreground/background. As it is, I've got some places to go back to now and I got to spend half a day thinking about composition.

<p>Well this seems to be what they've been doing over on David's blog over the weekend. I came to it late on today and having looked at the book and thought 'and?' I decided to take a deeper look to see if I was missing anything. <br /><br />The discussion seems to be about whether Mr Wright is using a different visual language and that the apparent lack of compositional and technical 'style' is an artistic affectation, and if so of what kind, or whether he is attempting to make transcendent landscape art but misses the mark in some way. <br /><br />I think the artist deserves to be listened to so I read through Harry's blog on the Times website and also looked through his websites and book output to see if there was anything I could glean. <br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that on his book covers and on his website, the featured images that have been chosen are the most visually compelling pictures in a typical landscape style; i.e. Luminous light, composed (loosely), etc. This sort of implies that there is at least a concious filtering of his images after the fact that fits with a real attempt to create traditionally 'beautiful' images. (of course this could be a cynical choice of images to try to draw the average punter in?).<br /><br />Given this, why are so many of the images so banal? Reading through the blog, it is often said that (paraphrase) 'I stayed in a location for a couple of days to absorb the environment and then took a picture right next to where I was parked/camped'. This doesn't seem to leave much room for choosing a view. With a 210 lens on, it's probably only possible to point in 8 different directions. <br /><br />However he then goes on to say that in some locations he spent time finding a location, asking locals where the best views were and even going to the the top of Meall Na Cuilce overlooking Loch Coruisk to get the final shot of the tour. <br /><br />If it weren't for this, I could start to understand his stated influences of Cindy Sherman, Thomas Struth, Neil Young and Paul Strand. The only one of these that really gives a hint at a minmalist viewpoint (the only explanation that springs to mind) is Thomas Struth's work but that is mostly about the viewers perception and social commentary. Neil Young is, I think, the singer thrown in for some trendy music references (Bob Marley is mentioned amongst other music references). Cindy Sherman is obviously post modernist but not in the context of the landscape. As for Paul Strand, I don't see any of his empathy with the communities in which he is taking his pictures.. Mr Wrights pictures are more reminiscent of Stephen Shore (or even Richard Misrach), which at least match with the look of the images and tallies with his mention of Thomas Struth, but this misses the mark in the fact that Shore was always about the human element, not the pure landscape and that Shore and his recent crop of modernists (Gursky etc) were/are very knowing. I get the feeling (and I may be wrong) that Mr Wright's images are produced out of Naivety rather than a knowing commentary on something.<br /><br />Mr Wright, on his blog, answers a question about his influence.<br /><br /><b>hcw</b><i>The camera I use gets more detail across than any camera I have ever used. It gives a relevance to everything in the frame. This allows the photographer to use it with great confidence, knowing that the final print will reveal more (not less) than you were able to take in at the time. The more I go on using the camera the less I worry about the detail and this lets me concentrate on the bigger thing; the feel of the whole place, the 'sum' as you say.</i><br /><br />This just suggests that he's enamoured of the 'resolution' as in "Who cares about the subject matter - look at the detail" or "As long as I'm pointing in roughly the right direction, the camera is bound to pick up what I'm seeing".<br /><br /><b>HCW:</b> <i>What do I look for? That's difficult to say, because as you get closer to taking the picture it varies. The night before I might decide where to go, and that's based on a bit of weather, where I was the day before, what someone's told me etc. But the most exciting bit is walking from where you have begun, knowing that the chances are that you about to get swept away by what's out there. The key I suppose is not to anticipate it all too much, and to try not to do what you have done before. </i> <br /><br />But how does this happen if he only takes pictures next to where he started. Nothing is really adding up to a consistent view, style or even goal.<br /><br />To paraphrase a couple of quotes from Mr Wright. "I select the spot from where to take picture: a promontory where I feel the view has been important or admired; bend in a track that has a sense of significance; crossing points of track and stream giving a sense of convergence not just of transport but of ways of living and history." - This does sound good but doesn't really tally with random pictures of hedgerows (however nice these seem) or beach scenes with little beach and a lot of sky, or a scrap of soil, etc.<br /><br />Overall I don't get a sense of any consistency. I see a photographer that can see beauty and occasionally capture it but who very often misses or confuses the experience with the realisation. This is not to say that he is a bad photographer, but he doesn't rate as a 'great' photographer in my opinion, despite taking some pictures that I really like (as seen below..); But for every one of these there is a picture that does nothing for me at all. <br /><br />My conclusion is that Mr Wright is a very good marketer (someone even adds fake reviews and ratings to his Amazon books) and has obviously hit a nerve with critics and at least one publisher, I think because of his similarity to the modernists mentioned above; but he doesn't really know what he wants to be and this shows in the book and through his writing. He's either a savant modernist that I don't understand or just happens to have hit this zeitgeist through a naive (and I don't mean this as an insult) approach to photography.<br /><br />Either way this is not the landscape photography that I really enjoy, even though I may enjoy individual pictures. I should add that there <b>is</b> something in some of the pictures that works in the way that it totally removes the photographer from the process; a deadpan, minimalist view of the landscape that leaves the viewer to do all of the work. If Mr Wright were to focus on this and develop this style, focusing on how to achieve a refined version of what he appears to do accidentally I'd interested in seeing a sequel.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.saltwater.co.uk/journey/images/5.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.saltwater.co.uk/journey/images/5.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.saltwater.co.uk/journey/images/2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.saltwater.co.uk/journey/images/2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.harrycorywright.com/gallery/files/images/detailed/d_697.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.harrycorywright.com/gallery/files/images/detailed/d_697.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.saltwater.co.uk/images/bg6.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.saltwater.co.uk/images/bg6.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></p><br /><br />Note: Some of the images initially used to show HCW's better style are now password protected and so have been removed.

Over the last couple of days I've been following and contributing to a <a href="http://oceansofinstants.blogspot.com/2007/11/to-make-or-not-to-make.html#links"> blog post</a> by David ward about taking photographs (or not).<br /><br />The comment thread drifted off into a discussion of David's photographic influence and whether he is influenced mostly by modern art. I don't want to comment about David's actual influences but a point was raised that abstraction in the landscape only really became popular in the 20th Century with post impressionism. <br /><br />Now I'm far from being an expert on the subject but I was sure that I had seen many 19th Century art that was non-figurative and wasn't trying to fit in with accepted norms for what was then mostly a commercial enterprise (i.e. most artists were in it for the money .. sort of)..<br /><br />The artists that immediately sprang to mind were the Japanese woodblock genius Katsushika Hokusai whom most of  you will know from his famous tidal wave and also his many illustrations of mount Fuji but is also a master of composition and simplification (<A HREF="http://visipix.dynalias.com/imageroot/Art1/031016_Hokusai/Hokusai_Collection/020616hok_14/0320/028750_0320.jpg" REL="nofollow">1</A>, <A HREF="http://visipix.dynalias.com/imageroot/Art1/031016_Hokusai/Hokusai_Collection/Mt_Fuji_Hoku_1_5-02-03/0320/029119_0320.jpg" REL="nofollow">2</A>, <A HREF="http://visipix.dynalias.com/imageroot/Art1/031016_Hokusai/Hokusai_Collection/Mt_Fuji_Hoku_1_5-02-03/0320/029130_0320.jpg" REL="nofollow">3</A>, <A HREF="http://visipix.dynalias.com/imageroot/Art1/031016_Hokusai/Hokusai_Collection/Mt_Fuji_Hoku_3_5-02-03/0320/029213_0320.jpg" REL="nofollow">4</A>, <A HREF="http://visipix.dynalias.com/imageroot/Art1/031016_Hokusai/Hokusai4/Picture1/0320/000707_0320.jpg" REL="nofollow">5</A>, <A HREF="http://visipix.dynalias.com/imageroot/Art1/031016_Hokusai/Hokusai_Collection/020616hok_07/0320/028082_0320.jpg" REL="nofollow">6</A>, <A HREF="http://visipix.dynalias.com/imageroot/Art1/031016_Hokusai/Hokusai_Collection/020616hok_07/0320/028094_0320.jpg" REL="nofollow">7</A>, <A HREF="http://visipix.dynalias.com/imageroot/Art1/031016_Hokusai/Hokusai_Collection/020616hok_07/0320/028097_0320.jpg" REL="nofollow">8</A> also see Hiroshige). Other artists were obviously <a href="http://www.valdostamuseum.org/hamsmith/Turner.gif">Turner</a> and <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/w/whistler/falling_rocket.jpg">Whistler</a> but I wanted to find out where the links were and who else to think about. Reading around a bit I discovered Gustave Courbet whose <a href="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/pic/BRGPOD/173471~The-Wave-1870-Posters.jpg">Wave</a> and <a href="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/pic/BRGPOD/141010~The-Grotto-of-the-Loue-1864-Posters.jpg">The Grotto of Loue</a> are classic photographic style compositions. It turns out that Gustave was a fan of and was influenced by photographic vision. The link between Hokusai is also confirmed in that many impressionists were obsessed with these recently imported artworks (especially Monet, Degas and Toulouse-lautrec).<br /><br />Looking at all of this, it seems that the birth of modern art was midwifed by photography and graphic art. The first allowed a gestalt perception and the latter gave the grounds with which to break with tradition, to show that there are no bounds and that different environment can create different perception. <br /><br />Once this started happening, photography and art walked hand in hand for many years, probably until the 1920's, 30's or even 40's - surrealism lived with photography for instance (at least a common law relationship). <br /><br />Anyway this was mostly me wanting to record my thoughts outside of David's blog..<br /><br />I also found some earlier landscape art which doesn't fit in with this post but is of interest Carl Gustav Carus and Caspar David Friedrich (and possibly Claude Lorrain are well worth looking at for an observational viewpoint. And whilst I'm at it .. Klimt's forests remind me of Mr Burkett.

</h3>
<div class='post-header-line-1'></div>
<div class='post-body entry-content'>
Over the last few months I've been asking myself a question that is particularly difficult to answer. Why do I take pictures? The obvious answer to a lot of people is because I enjoy it and I've been told I produce things that people like when I do it. But this doesn't really satisfy me as an answer because it doesn't say what it is about it that I enjoy and if the reason I do it is so that people can tell me I'm good, I feel particularly shallow.<br /><br />So now I've got a few more questions. What do I enjoy about photography? Apart from my own enjoyment, what am I trying to acheive?<br /><br />Well this gets a little closer. I started off taking photographs and enjoying it before I showed other people so it can't be to do with that - or was I expecting or wanting to impress other people - the joy of anticipation perhaps. Oh dear.. <br /><br />Let's take a couple of thought experiments. If I were to carry on photography but I could never show anybody else my work, would I still do it. Gosh! That's a tough one. I think my answer would have to be yes. I actually enjoy the process of taking landscape photographs. Starting with the location and ending with an interpretation that I think captures my intentions is a complex puzzle that I get a 'buzz' out of solving. The buzz is even more exciting but also more frustrating because there is no one correct answer and there is also no way of saying whether the answer is correct.<br /><br />So I like puzzle solving. Solving the puzzle also means learning what the puzzle is; What the pieces do and where can I put them. This means there is an ongoing learning process to solve the puzzle. Hang on! Learning the puzzle also means knowing how to judge the answer better. The obvious conclusion from this is that depending on how you learn to understand the puzzle can affect your conclusions on whether the puzzle is actually solved. In other words, my great solution is actually wrong in somebody elses eyes.  <br /><br />This leads to the conclusion that it doesn't matter what I do as long as I learn the puzzle in a way that lets me solve it. This is obviously not right... There must be something I'm missing. <br /><br />Whatever I say about not caring about what people think about my pictures it isn't totally true. When I've solved my own puzzles in a particularly satisfying way, I really would like to share this. I want to say "look - here's my solution!" and I want to share it with people who go "Wow.. although I have a different solution personally, I know enough about the puzzle to admire the way you've solved it" or "Hang on - here is a bit of the puzzle you might not have thought about - does that change the way you perceive your solution".. <br /><br />So now we have start to put together an environment of shared understanding of what the puzzle is. The general public (sorry general!) have a personal understanding of the puzzle that they have inherited/developed without thought and some of my solutions might also look like some of their solutions..  Some people have spent their whole lives looking at different solutions and have developed a language to describe them that I don't understand myself (I think they are called critics) and then there are a whole lot of people who publish 'Solve your puzzle the easy way' books with lists of simple solutions that look complete (I think they're called editors and writers).<br /><br />What I have to decide is how many different types of person (and hence puzzle types) do I want to satisfy. Some photographers manage to produce work that satisfies many, many different people understanding of the puzzle, even puzzle afficianados (Joe Cornish seems to have hit a few of the core puzzle fundamentals but does so whilst also satisying some of the deeper understandings).<br /><br />Dumping that metaphor, what I'm getting at with the puzzle is a combination of many things.. There are visual configurations that are pleasing to the eye; there are structures that can lead the eye around a picture; there are types of texture and light that are associated with warm fuzziness (a technical term I think). All of these are aspects of photography that invoke our hindbrain. These are shared visual triggers that can evoke emotional reaction. A photographer that wants to control the reaction to their pictures needs to understand these fundamental concepts. We can think about these concepts as the grammar of language. If we use the grammar correctly, we will always produce sentences - whether they carry meaning depends on the right words.<br /><br />Then there are more complex visual ideas that rely on a shared visual language. Some of this shared visual language is innate (like some of the ideas mentioned in the last paragraph) but some of the ideas are learnt through exposure to photography/art.   Fine art is drenched in these metaphors and allusions. With photography the availability of language is more limited. With landscape photography, I'm still looking for a beginners dictionary. <br /><br />What I want to achieve at minimum is to express my feelings when I'm out in the landscape. What I'd like to achieve is to be able to control how I express my feelings through photography - how to transcend the basic grammar of beauty and be able to communicate a message that whispers long sentences rather than shouting one liners. <br /><br />What I also know is that I'll never reach my goal because as I learn more about the way this visual language works, I'll expect more of myself. I wrote a footer on my profile on a photo discussion site about 18 months ago that said 'Tim Parkin - Happily Unsatisfied'. I wrote it quickly from the top of my head and then thought 'How sad does that sound' .. over the last 12 months I've realised that being unsatisfied is not necessarily a bad thing.. Small doses of satisfaction are good but to be completely satisfied all of the time, I don't think I would enjoy it. <br /><br />So .. why do I take pictures? I take pictures to express something; to myself, to understanding colleagues and peers. I take pictures to learn how pictures work. I take pictures to understand what I see and how I can transform it. I take pictures to learn about the world; to learn about myself; to talk to other people about the journey I'm taking..  <br /><br />I'm hoping that as I get further down the journey I can more eloquently express myself too :-)

On Saturday we got up 5.30 am ready to make a little pilgrimage to Gordale Scar, a location chosen because I had a certain composition in mind and I've never got a particularly satisfying shot from their. The morning was that combination of dampness and cold that seems to eat into your bones even though you know you've coped with icy conditions ten time worse. When we were close, it was pretty apparent that we weren't going to get anything particularly impressive, and we'd be lucky if we got some light, however the river was in particularly high flow and the waterfalls should be pretty impressive.<br /><br />And impressive they were! Unfortunately, with the rain included, the whole of Gordale was one great big waterfall... I'd brought my waders to see if I could get up to a higher level in the waterfall and indeed I could but the amount of flying water meant that I couldn't spend much time composing (or checking focus .. hmmm). The result showed the possibility of potential at some point... I need to go back and spend more time...<br /><br />On the way out I wanted to try an angle I'd previsiualised (but it didn't look like I wanted - at least not with the light as flat as it was) and so we went over to Janet's Foss, slopping along with my oversize waders on (for which I got justified wierdo stares). Janet's Foss is pretty impressive but spectacularly dull with no light, not greenery (or orangery) and when it's flowing so big that there is no subtelty. The other direction, down the river, looked a little more promising and is probably the only shot that I'm happy with from our little trip. <br /><br />I really need to spend more time at a location though and Charlotte has very kindly said that she's happy to sit around in one place and pass the time. What an understanding wife :-)

Newark may not be the flattest place in the world but it's flat enough to have nothing much but topsoil and slow flowing water.<br /><br />I was at my Parent's in Law to meet up with my Julia and Stuart, friends of Charlotte's from University/School, and wanted to get some photography (I feel lost if I can't take pictures) so went out looking for subject matter. The only things I could find on the OS map were small copses so we went for a little walk. No LF work and the two were taken in their back garden. The first picture is a foxglove which was thriving in local Pheasant breeding wood.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R0tZX8yTL2I/AAAAAAAAAOQ/d_h45W1p8Ds/s1600-h/IMG_58131.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R0tZX8yTL2I/AAAAAAAAAOQ/d_h45W1p8Ds/s320/IMG_58131.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5137298067935145826" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R0tZX8yTL3I/AAAAAAAAAOY/oLRK5H7FbEk/s1600-h/IMG_58171.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R0tZX8yTL3I/AAAAAAAAAOY/oLRK5H7FbEk/s320/IMG_58171.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5137298067935145842" /></a>

</h3>
<div class='post-header-line-1'></div>
<div class='post-body entry-content'>
Light and Land are a company who many of you will know that specialise in photographic holidays, mostly landscape, in the UK and beyond. I took part in a Hebrides special in April of this year which I thoroughly enjoyed which resulted in my foray into the world of LF. They held a 'discovery' day this month where many photographers attend to meet the tour guides and watch presentations on photography. <br /><br />I went down to the hotel in Reading a day early because of the long drive and also because I was hoping to have a chance to talk to other photographers, generally an enjoyable if obsessive bunch. <br /><br />On the Saturday I spent most of the afternoon in the lobby of the hotel making the most of the free wireless access in order to catch up with some web development work on the This World website (which is just launching - check out <a href="http://www.this-world.com/">http://www.this-world.com</a>) and also to make a couple of tweaks to David Ward's website. Whilst I was doing this I saw Baxter Bradford and had a good chat about websites (he's currently developing his new site), using reversal film to increase dynamic range (some great example shots he has) and digital raw conversion programs (and a company that specialising in removing 5D antialiasing filters).<br /><br />Later on I had a chat with Nigel Halliwell, whose photography I admire, and Paul Gallagher, a black and white photographer that I had only just found out about through seeing his pictures in Developing Vision and Style (a light and land book in association with David Ward, Joe Cornish and Charlie Waite - plus lots of great contributions from other photographers). The conversations were suitably geekily photographic as expected. I also had the opportunity to introduce myself to Charlie Waite, who graciously agreed to chat about a project I have in mind.<br /><br />The night ended late and the morning wasn't far behind. The day itself was a wonderful mix of old faces (most of the Hebrides course were their, Gerry Gavigan, Phil Staff, Jane Goodall, Melanie Foster) and people whose names I'd only seen in print (Roger Longdin at lunch) and some of the 'glitterati' (Joe Cornish, Ben Osborne, Niall Benvie, etc etc - most of the Light and Land tour guides apart from Duncan McEwan in fact). I said hello to Eddie Ephraums whose talk on book publishing made me realise that this could be the most effective way of reaching a wider audience and potentially selling pictures - a home made book or even a digitally published one should be straightforward but I think the appropriate project is needed first.<br /><br />The talks that most moved me were Joe's and David's .. Their search for a path even at their stage in their development is something that is both reassuring and humbling in some ways. They are very different photographers in many ways but I get the feeling that Joe admires David's persistent focus and I imagine that he feels tethered by his ability to create instantly attractive pictures where sometimes this instant beauty clouds the consistent depth in his compositions.. What is certain though is that they both strive to make their photography mean something to themselves and are not happy to just create pretty pictures. I love to see both of their repertoire develop and feel privileged if I can help one of them reach a wider audience. <br /><br />Charlie's talk was also about the uncertainty that photography brings and the fact that progression/change is more important that achievement. Satisfaction seems to come from responding to challenges, either external or more importantly internal.<br /><br />Looking around the stands was certainly interesting and I was most impressed by the Paramo gear and will probably be making a purchase of a new waterproof and possibly a gilet. <br /><br />Finally, I got to meet with Charlie Waite who was the gentleman you would expect. I would highly recommend getting his 'art of seeing' DVD, the man is just as you see him.<br /><br />Overall, I was very impressed and would like to thank David and Jenny Ward and the Light and Land crew for putting in so much effort.

It wasn't the best weather but it's always good to know an area a bit before you have the real opportunity to take photographs.<br /><br />Well with 40 gusting 50 winds and lots of sand around, the chances of me getting my large format camera out were minimal. However, I did take some 5D snapshots and scouted out the type of photograph I would like to take. The last time we went to whitby, there wasn't a lot to see and I wondered how people could possibly take the beautiful shots I had seen (especially <a href="http://www.melaniefoster.co.uk/">Melanie Foster</a>'s!).<br /><br />This time I started to see the possibilities.. You see it's all down to sand movement. Although the rocks around Whitby pier are beautiful, most of the time you can only see the tip of the iceberg. However, around stormy weather and with a receding tide, tonnes of sand can be removed, leaving the textured and coloured rock for all to see! The enemy of great shots however, are students..  In this case 1st year Geology students who were swarming over the rocks and sand like flies.. (I shouldn't criticise them as Geology is an amazing subject). <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzoasZ79WCI/AAAAAAAAANg/yksR_01zm9A/s1600-h/IMG_57641.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzoasZ79WCI/AAAAAAAAANg/yksR_01zm9A/s400/IMG_57641.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132444075521038370" /></a><br /><br /><br />There were parts of the beach that weren't completely wrecked and I managed to take the couple of shots you see here in the 15 minutes spent on the beach before the rain came back again. Off the fish and chip shop and then a quick drive to sands end (mmm.... groynes!!) and check out the access road to Saltwick bay (people were fishing! nutters!) and then back home..<br /><br />A little research on the Internet came up with the results mentioned earlier in that the best time to go would be as a storm surge is working it's way up the North sea and just after a high tide.. Theres a couple of dates in December that look promising!<br /><br />The previous day I played around in a small copse near my Brother in Law's house.. Nothing to write home about, but obviously enough to blog about.. End result here..<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R0tRcMyTL0I/AAAAAAAAAOA/A1NJMirzLOw/s1600-h/IMG_57491.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R0tRcMyTL0I/AAAAAAAAAOA/A1NJMirzLOw/s400/IMG_57491.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5137289344856567618" /></a>

You may have seen my <a href="2007/07/other-lf-accessories.html">previous</a> <a href="2007/09/more-blackjacket.html">posts</a> about the <a href="http://www.quietworks.com/FRAMES_FILES/BJ_SPECIFICATIONS/BJ_NEW_HOME_FRAME_.htm">BlackJacket</a> which is a 'high tech' dark cloth for large format cameras. Since I've been using my black jacket on the ebony for some I found that there was still some light leakage around the sides of the groundglass caused by the 'neck' of the BlackJacket not fitting flush around the bellows. Also, the velcro on the inside of the neck that the BlackBag attaches to is both fairly weak and also not positioned particularly well for the layout of the ebony. In order to fix these I had to get the needle and thread out and also buy some new velcro and some elastic material. <br /><br />The first photo shows the extra velcro I have added to the inside of the neck that will hold the BlackBag :-<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyejBuEDOOI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/iPjC8OQuDc8/s1600-h/IMG_5719.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyejBuEDOOI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/iPjC8OQuDc8/s400/IMG_5719.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127245950724815074" /></a><br /><br />The velcro has only been connected on one edge as this makes it easier to grab and lift towards the ground glass. You can see the positioning better in this photo :-<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyekMuEDORI/AAAAAAAAAIo/wt2-_tgvk9s/s1600-h/IMG_5716.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyekMuEDORI/AAAAAAAAAIo/wt2-_tgvk9s/s400/IMG_5716.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127247239215003922" /></a> <br /><br />The second picture shows how the BlackBag fits onto this velcro :-<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyejbeEDOPI/AAAAAAAAAIY/0iliJ9lu6hE/s1600-h/IMG_5720.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyejbeEDOPI/AAAAAAAAAIY/0iliJ9lu6hE/s400/IMG_5720.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127246393106446578" /></a><br /><br />It might even make sense to replace the velcro on the bag as the 'hook and loop' type velcro isn't as strong as normal velcro.<br /><br />The next picture shows the addition I have made to the neck of the BlackJacket to allow me to make the neck more light tight.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Ryej9uEDOQI/AAAAAAAAAIg/IVfkUGfUoQw/s1600-h/IMG_5714.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Ryej9uEDOQI/AAAAAAAAAIg/IVfkUGfUoQw/s400/IMG_5714.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127246981516966146" /></a><br /><br />This allows the closing of the neck as below :-<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Ryekg-EDOSI/AAAAAAAAAIw/o6Cf-uzkIrw/s1600-h/IMG_5722.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Ryekg-EDOSI/AAAAAAAAAIw/o6Cf-uzkIrw/s400/IMG_5722.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127247587107354914" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyekiOEDOTI/AAAAAAAAAI4/Y5mdeJErmx4/s1600-h/IMG_5723.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyekiOEDOTI/AAAAAAAAAI4/Y5mdeJErmx4/s400/IMG_5723.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127247608582191410" /></a><br /><br />Using this makes the whole shebang considerably more light tight and isn't much extra effort to use and my Ebony feels snug as a bug in a rug.. :-)

This is a pouch that holds the quickload holder itself and upto 40 quickloads. It has a hook at the top and is intended to hang off your tripod when you are setting up and taking your shot. Having seen one in Jack Dykinga's book and not trusting myself with lots of bits of sheet film and notes etc., I ordered the item from America (paying almost as much in postage as I did for the item itself). Despite having to wait over two months for the item (and phoning Justin Gnass a couple of times to remind him, both of which he said they're just going out of the door) I was and am still very impressed. I should add that Justin was very polite and apologetic on the phone but it seems he's not the most organised person in the world and although I don't think he's intentionally dishonest, he could do with being more open about timescales for delivery. <br /><br />Anyway, back to the item itself. It's made out of a strong nylon fabric and is very well stitched. It has two main pockets and a little pocket to hold the top of the quickload holder (as seen in the picture below).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Ryem_uEDOVI/AAAAAAAAAJI/p6MVYu-W0Fg/s1600-h/IMG_5655.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Ryem_uEDOVI/AAAAAAAAAJI/p6MVYu-W0Fg/s400/IMG_5655.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127250314411587922" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Ryem_-EDOWI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/iyFybmNEZow/s1600-h/IMG_5656.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Ryem_-EDOWI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/iyFybmNEZow/s400/IMG_5656.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127250318706555234" /></a><br /><br />I keep my quickload holder in the top pocket and the bottom pocket contains my quickload film and notepad and pencil. The pockets are fairly deep and I can move up to 15 quickloads up to the top pocket as they are taken.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyenzOEDOXI/AAAAAAAAAJY/_VHY6XoF-yA/s1600-h/IMG_5658.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyenzOEDOXI/AAAAAAAAAJY/_VHY6XoF-yA/s400/IMG_5658.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127251199174850930" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyenzeEDOYI/AAAAAAAAAJg/hhF45mxZg3g/s1600-h/IMG_5657.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyenzeEDOYI/AAAAAAAAAJg/hhF45mxZg3g/s400/IMG_5657.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127251203469818242" /></a><br /><br />The design of the holder is such that when it is closed, there is a velcro front flap that closes the whole unit. This does a fair job of keeping everything together. As can be seen, when the unit is opened, the two pockets are staggered to allow easy access. <br /><br />This makes it a nice fit next to my camera and BlackJacket in the camera bag.. Anything that helps my workflow during the planning and taking of pictures is a welcome addition to my arsenal.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyeoS-EDOZI/AAAAAAAAAJo/O8zz4gT0f2I/s1600-h/IMG_5659.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RyeoS-EDOZI/AAAAAAAAAJo/O8zz4gT0f2I/s400/IMG_5659.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127251744635697554" /></a>

Finding suitable subject matter for the sunrise and under time pressure is a little scary. I managed to get a shot off just at sunrise itself and a couple of digital only before sunrise (the top shot is about 10 mins before).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5ZAiKUR2XI/AAAAAAAAASo/YyBeoLPCBdg/s1600-h/IMG_5605-Edit1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5ZAiKUR2XI/AAAAAAAAASo/YyBeoLPCBdg/s400/IMG_5605-Edit1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5158381378828622194" /></a><br /><br />Some of my digital shots came out too dark in the foreground even with 5 stops of grad.. we'll have to see how Velvia holds up but I'm not expecting much..<br /><br />On the way out we saw a peak in the background which must have been mow cop but it looked like a mini Fuji peeking through the mist. We scouted around for a bit of foreground and some rose bay willow herb and a small stone building worked really well  in black and white (the colours were a mix of cold and warm unfortunately - not pretty)<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5ZAi6UR2YI/AAAAAAAAASw/2atPPuYRM3E/s1600-h/IMG_56241.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/R5ZAi6UR2YI/AAAAAAAAASw/2atPPuYRM3E/s400/IMG_56241.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5158381391713524098" /></a>

We walked the length of Glencoe but there wasn't much to be seen that didn't need a lot of time spent working a small location (and I have to remember that this is a holiday for a non-photographer as well). But I did get a standard big rock and background shot of two of the sisters as seen below. <br /><br />The main picture was taken that afternoon when I popped out on my own to see if there was anything worth taking around Glencoe village. This was taken just outside the village on the back road up to Clachaig and was almost a throwaway shot at the time (I'd wandered around looking for good 'Autumn' shots) but I'd been looking at Christopher Burkett pictures and Dave Schilliger and it must have rubbed off a little. This doesn't mean that I think this picture is in anywhere near the same league but I feel it has a similar understated effect.. shame about the fence at the bottom right...<br /><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzuC9asAWsI/AAAAAAAAANw/UyMmys6XKSQ/s1600-h/IMG_53771.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzuC9asAWsI/AAAAAAAAANw/UyMmys6XKSQ/s400/IMG_53771.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132840191966337730" /></a>

There is even more enjoyment to be had when photographing a beautiful location under beautiful light. One of the highest levels of enjoyment I have yet experienced is photographing a beautiful location that is little known in beautiful light. Although experiencing a landscape shouldn't be marred by knowing that thousands of other people have seen it, there is a frisson of pleasure that comes from knowing that you have found somewhere that isn't normally visited.<br /><br />In my case, this was so close to the busiest area of Glencoe that it is surprising that  this isn't more travelled. We found an area on the map called just 'The Study' and had to see what was there.. To get to the location, one had to cross a small stream (wading) climb a large bank and follow the drovers road for about 800yds..<br /><br />Just about 3pm and an hour and a half before sunset we crested the ridge and the photo at the top of this post was in view before us. After a brief hesitation whilst taking the view in, the camera came out.. Just as I was putting my 5D on the tripod, I saw the last wisps of cloud being burned off Aogach Eanach and got the shot just as it curled over on itself.  I also took a couple of large format shots but the dynamic range was a bit large (maybe blending would work?) and the cloud has burned off, leaving the whole picture a lot less dynamic. A glorious experience and one I'd highly recommend.

I'm not sure if I learned quickly because I thought about it differently or because I'd already used a tilt shift lens on my 35mm camera but I have an explanation of the effects that don't involve maths or mr Scheimpflug..<br /><br />Basically it goes like this.. On a large format camera, you focus by moving the film place closer to or further away from the lens. If you want to focus on infinity, you move the film plane Xmm away from the lens (where X is your focal length). So on a 150mm length, you want to have 15cm between the lens and your film.<br /><br />If you want to focus closer, you move the film plane further away from the lens.. This is how all cameras work (except in a 35mm camera, the movement generally goes on inside the lens body).<br /><br />So... if we tilt the lens plane so that the bottom half of the film is closer to the lens than the top half, then the bottom half is focused closer to infinity. And thats that! All of the maths is just there to help you understand the relation between the tilt angle and the focus distances..<br /><br />Swing is the same, if the left hand side of the film is further away from the lens than the right hand lens. Then the left side of the picture will be focused closer (actually it's the right side because of things getting flipped.. you can see it on the ground glass anyway).<br /><br />If you apply tilt and swing, you basically have a custom focus for each corner of the film... However working out how much combination isn't particularly easy.<br /><br />The example at the top of this post needed a little swing to help the top of  the wall be in focus.. If it wasn't for the wall, I could have just used some tilt and made sure the heather was in focus and the middle of the gulley was in focus (near the light trees). But because the focus spread close to the camera is a lot lower than the focus spread at infinity, the top of the wall will be out of focus (or need a very large aperture). <br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzjNy579V-I/AAAAAAAAANA/ZyqTUgyJZsM/s1600-h/IMG_53001-3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzjNy579V-I/AAAAAAAAANA/ZyqTUgyJZsM/s400/IMG_53001-3.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132078049818138594" /></a><br /><br />In order to minise this, I knew I needed to get the focal plan something like in the picture below.. To do this, I know I need to put about half of the angle that I have used for tilt into the swing, as seen below.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzjN9J79V_I/AAAAAAAAANI/8L7THG0ngNM/s1600-h/IMG_53001-2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzjN9J79V_I/AAAAAAAAANI/8L7THG0ngNM/s400/IMG_53001-2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132078225911797746" /></a><br /><br />This was taken just outside our chalet in Clachaig.. the result isn't that brilliant but it was a nice exercise.

I had thought of this and had plans to have a 'guard' around if I were to take any urban shots (which I may do for one of our company buildings, more on that possibly later). What I didn't take into account is that it can still be a little dangerous even at 7am in the middle of Rannoch Moor.. Here's how it goes..<br /><br />Being as I'm still excited about the great weather and being in Glencoe, I couldn't help but get up early again for a Rannoch Moor sunrise. Charlotte was happy to let me go on my own (it's strange with non photographers.. Going back to the same location and standing around for hours doesn't seem to excite them) and so I drove up to Rannoch Moor 80 minutes before sunrise (just to see what it looked like). Well, at 60 minutes to sunrise, I tried a 30 second exposure on the digital and got this <br /><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzeFOZ79V0I/AAAAAAAAALw/_5_Xklx3iX0/s1600-h/IMG_52441.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzeFOZ79V0I/AAAAAAAAALw/_5_Xklx3iX0/s400/IMG_52441.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5131716782939002690" /></a><br /><br />Which isn't quite enough light to take anything unless I wanted to try 3 or 4 minute exposures (and being as I had no clue what I was taking, I thought I'll stick with the experiment). So, another 30 minutes later (30 mins before sunrise) a 30 second exposure got this ... <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzeFOZ79V1I/AAAAAAAAAL4/19aLg6fFEo0/s1600-h/IMG_52541.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzeFOZ79V1I/AAAAAAAAAL4/19aLg6fFEo0/s400/IMG_52541.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5131716782939002706" /></a><br /><br />Whilst undoubtedly better, it's still not going to win any Take That View (or whatever the competition is called). So it's off to the other side of the road and back to the nikky nakky noo lake...<br /><br />after lining up the shot at the top of the post, and starting to get some Scheimpflug on, I heard some baying in the background.. Ah! Dear I thought.. how nice! I wonder if I'll get to see any? Focus.. focus.. curse.. focus.. "MOOOOOOOO!!!!" to which I reply  "ARGH!!"  and nearly stand up and knock my Ebony into the lake. "What the hell was that?" I pulled off my BlackJacket and looked to my left and 40ft away is the scene shown below...<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzeFO579V3I/AAAAAAAAAMI/KMOypHEhxLc/s1600-h/IMG_52721.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzeFO579V3I/AAAAAAAAAMI/KMOypHEhxLc/s400/IMG_52721.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5131716791528937330" /></a><br /><br />I very slowly (but quickly) got my 5D out and recorded the evidence and then just stood there and watched them whilst they merrily trotted around.. Absolutly gobsmacked, I found it quite difficult to get back under the darkcloth to finish the exposure - but I did :-)  ... All I can say is it's a good job I didn't have a lens cloth hanging out of my back pocket ;-)<br /><br />Later in the day we drive around and try to get a shot of Castle Stalker (but the access was awful, it also stank) and went up to some falls on the way to Fort William (Inchree falls if I remember correctly) which were pretty dull (you can't actually get to them). As a last jaunt out, I drove quickly up the road to Altnafeadh and took  a shot of the river Etive and the houses nearby.. This was taken about 30 yards from the road and should be returning to me soon on a black and white negative (Fuji Acros).<br /><br />and at the end of the day I saw<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzeFPJ79V4I/AAAAAAAAAMQ/qwN--rA6r9g/s1600-h/IMG_52981.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzeFPJ79V4I/AAAAAAAAAMQ/qwN--rA6r9g/s400/IMG_52981.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5131716795823904642" /></a>

The place we stay (The Clachaig Inn's chalets) is beautiul, comfortable and so handy it's untrue.. The first morning we went out to the 'usual' spot to try to get a dawn photo (trying to avoid the cliche tree - now you know which spot). There was a very pleasant photographer from Edinburgh there before me and we had a good chat. I took a large format shot of my composition which has come out (The first version is the LF shot and the second is my Digital of the same place.. Incredible differences in colour, probably because of the way I have converted it (I took a photograph of it with a macro lens on the light table).<br /><br />Composing this shot was a pleasure because it's my first real photo where I haven't been completely stressed by the process (well, it was still interesting trying to sort out the exposure - in this case taken of a mid gray on the rocks and a high mark on the light in the hills.<br /><br />Then we took a drive up to Glen Orchy but my wife was a little tired and wanted to go on a walk rather than hang around in the same place (which was a shame as the location looked like it could be fantastic fun to spend the day photographing at). <br /><br />However we decided to go for a drive down Glen Etive with the aim of walking down the right hand side of the glen. Unfortunately we were harrased by ticks, bogged down beyond beleif and swarmed by midges.. I could have coped with any of these on their own but with progress of about half a mile in 40 minutes we turned back, just as this view lit up.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzD0O66SFZI/AAAAAAAAALI/Zhn39t18Ews/s1600-h/IMG_51921.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzD0O66SFZI/AAAAAAAAALI/Zhn39t18Ews/s400/IMG_51921.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5129868512744052114" /></a><br /><br />I did try to get a large format shot but the foreground was very soon lit up with direct sunlight which ruined the effect.<br /><br />Finally, we walked up robbers falls where the ticks came out in force to the point where we had to wear snoods and hats to stop them sneaking into our hair and down our fronts. Despite this, on the way down I saw this gorgeous tree and the light breaking through it. Again no LF shot as, although my gut said it was beautiful, I couldn't work out why and hence didn't take one. Trust my gut more...<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzD1K66SFcI/AAAAAAAAALg/vUNQ0lDsU9c/s1600-h/IMG_52241.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzD1K66SFcI/AAAAAAAAALg/vUNQ0lDsU9c/s400/IMG_52241.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5129869543536203202" /></a>

At 4am we were up and in the car (you know you're early when you wake up fishermen on your drive out of the house) and on our way up to the north of the island. 1.5 hours later we were at the foot of the Storr and there was a hint of light on the horizon and up til stopping the card, the view had been cloudless.. Unfortunately, as we looked up we could see some cover at the top of the hill... Never the less, and despite the cold and dark, we kitted up with gaiters, waterproofs and head torches and made our way up through the dark and forbodeing forest. About 5 minutes into the journey, the white noise we could hear revealed itself as rain and it seemed we might be in for a bit of a rough start. The climb was interesting but fairly hard and we got to the foot of the Storr to a howling gale, 30ft visibility and horizontal rain. Having got a large waterproof blanket and an oversize golfing umbrella, we retreated to the shelter of the forest and decided to see if we could wait it out. Two flasks of cofee, a couple of chocolate bars and two chapters of our favourites books and we concluded that this was a bit of a bad day again. Back down the mountain and drive back to Portree... And guess what, bloody sunshine!! Too tired to give a crap at this point, we drive back to Elgol. <br /><br />The evening turned out a lot nicer but still couldn't provide a sunset of any sort. I tried to find a more interesting portrait of the Behemoth and also a detail shot of the honeycomb rock that wasn't cliched. I think I managed something interesting in the Behemoth shot, especially the green pool, but I should have positioned the Behemoth itself so it was falling into the picture (it was too dark to actually see much balance in the frame at this point - a crap excuse which means I was too hassled to relax enough to concentrate).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzDqGa6SFWI/AAAAAAAAAKw/pMXYG_CQkY4/s1600-h/IMG_51521.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzDqGa6SFWI/AAAAAAAAAKw/pMXYG_CQkY4/s400/IMG_51521.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5129857371598886242" /></a>

A couple of excellent examples are <a href="http://www.isleofskye.net/threeherons/kenbryan/cuillin/">Blaven and The Cuillin</a>, <a href="http://www.isleofskye.net/threeherons/img/oi01b.jpg">A magnificent tree stump</a> and a <a href="http://www.isleofskye.net/threeherons/img/rr01b.jpg">beautiful Etive rock forms</a>.<br /><br />The second gallery we visited was <a href="http://www.woodrising-photography.co.uk/Pages_Main/Main_Images.html">Wood Rising</a> gallery which looked very interesting until I realised that I was getting bored of every picture almost as soon as I'd seen it. There were three or four good pictures (a good shot of sligachen and a couple of good intimate landscapes - mushrooms, moss and bark) but lots of very knee jerk twilight horizons.<br /><br />With a bit of this inspiration, I drove up and down the Elgol road trying to find something that wasn't as formulaic and the tree shot and the panorama here are what I got. The the tree shot was a fight against time and flare, with the light dissapearing rapidly and no chance of a 4x5. The end result is quite vital and is fairly popular. The panorama just doesn't quite work for me though, it's a little too flat and I don't like the colour.. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzDuZq6SFYI/AAAAAAAAALA/Y-Qf-MiHtuU/s1600-h/IMG_51301.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RzDuZq6SFYI/AAAAAAAAALA/Y-Qf-MiHtuU/s400/IMG_51301.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5129862100357879170" /></a>

Unfortunately the weather was, again, pretty dire and although there were one or two blasts of light through the clouds, there wasn't enough to warm things up and there was very little wave action. The ground around the rocks was fairly barren (no thrift out) and the Castle itself had that typical worn look that most popular attractions acquire at the hands (and feet) of many travellers. We should have walked over to the far side but by this time a bitter wind had arisen and we retreated back to 'Fawlty Towers' (The Duntulm Hotel) for a quick dinner. We drove back down past Uig to the Fairy glen where we were hounded by outrageously intelligent guard sheep. Despite being followed by our  ovine friend, I did manage to find an interesting location but the weather kept causing problems (wind, rain, blanket grey clouds). We should have walked around a little more but it's pyscologically difficult to shake off the disspointment of being in a great location with dreary light. I took a couple of large format shots to see how much Velvia could rescue the situation but I have a feeling even this fabulous film can't recover this much.

I waited around to see if I could get some twighlight shots and was intent on capturing the character of the large stone slab that must have broken off the ledge at the elgol beach many, many years ago. The first picture (shown above) was intended to be as imposing as possible and I also wanted to capture the texture of the surface of the water (inspired by Richard Childs picture of another part of the surface seen <a href="http://www.richardchildsphotography.co.uk/images/gallery/8/00001058/74027l.jpg">here</a>).<br /><br />The evening was also one of the lowest tides of the year and despite the following not being the best composition, I wanted to record the shape of the underlying rocks.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rye6lOEDOeI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/2zwvqQght2Q/s1600-h/IMG_50541.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rye6lOEDOeI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/2zwvqQght2Q/s400/IMG_50541.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127271849377610210" /></a><br /><br />My final composition of the evening was from a position I had seen on the first night and came back to later in the holiday. The shape of the crack in the rocks appealed and I went on to take two more photographs around this structure.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rye6lOEDOfI/AAAAAAAAAKY/emhd8nBWt6I/s1600-h/IMG_5053-Edit1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rye6lOEDOfI/AAAAAAAAAKY/emhd8nBWt6I/s400/IMG_5053-Edit1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127271849377610226" /></a>

Sunday was one of these and because we had just arrived in Elgol, and I had the amazing rocky foreground and the Cuillins in the background, I wasn't looking in front of my feet for opportunity. The day was overcast and often raining and even though I knew it wasn't the weather for the Vista I was still looking for it, and in the process missing lots of opportunities. <br /><br />Sometimes you need to forget what you came for in order to find opportunity.<br /><br />The Monday was a total transformation however. By 10am we were over on the other side of the Cuillin at Fairy Pools and it was T Shirt off weather and I had a completely different problem; Too much light and a completely blue sky with no clouds. I also think I was in the same problem head space where I wanted to make the most of the larger vista; However this time at least I tried to take some more intimate shots, even if they weren't forthcoming. The intense light bleached everything of interest and gradation. The best result I got was as follows.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rye2hOEDObI/AAAAAAAAAJ4/VqlQAisp-n8/s1600-h/IMG_4987.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rye2hOEDObI/AAAAAAAAAJ4/VqlQAisp-n8/s400/IMG_4987.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127267382611622322" /></a><br /><br /><br />I also, in desperation it must be said, took a single 4x5 frame of a tree in a ravine. I used an 81A filter (but the B might have been better). However I think I took a photograph of what I saw rather than what was on the ground glass, often completely different things. In this case, I saw the 3D depth of the ravine, the fine detail of the leaves and the flowing water - all of which don't translate well into a composition. Next time I'll close one eye and listen to my and go with my gut feeling when I see the groundglass.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rye2lOEDOcI/AAAAAAAAAKA/JwtkbdQqHNg/s1600-h/IMG_5024.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rye2lOEDOcI/AAAAAAAAAKA/JwtkbdQqHNg/s400/IMG_5024.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5127267451331099074" /></a><br /><br />The photo at the top of this is a picture looking up to where we walked (if you look carefully at the one of the river, you can see our car just below the forest).

It also includes spaces for reciprocity readings (and a little recipocity table for velvia at the bottom).<br /><br />This table has proven very useful during the Scotland trip and the only screwed up exposures so far have been down to either me panicking about not having enough light to get back (and curtailing exposure prematurely), not reading very low light well (below 1 EV) and finally suffering from too much wishful thinking regarding the dynamic range of Velvia. The remaining exposures have mostly been OK and also, because I have made very good notes, I can reassess exposure when I get back to check I haven't made any obvious mistakes (which I have used a 2 or 3 times varying from a -0.5 to a plus 1.5).<br /><br />Since the holiday I've reviewed the exposure chart again based on usage and realised that the sketch is the most useful item if you have time to do it and, along with the check list and general record taking, is sufficient to store all the information about exposure, filtration, tilt/shift/swing/rise/fall/warp/weft.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RxvTLMGPeoI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/v7NSRQN5Ig0/s1600-h/quickexposure-v3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RxvTLMGPeoI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/v7NSRQN5Ig0/s400/quickexposure-v3.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5123921190243498626" /></a>

Our self catering cottage was almost on the beach itself which meant quick access if we had great weather.. Unfortunately we had some pretty bad weather but it was only wet on two days out of the six so I won't be complaining. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rx0sPcGPeuI/AAAAAAAAAIA/1H4mGqpcMPA/s1600-h/IMG_51491.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rx0sPcGPeuI/AAAAAAAAAIA/1H4mGqpcMPA/s400/IMG_51491.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5124300594769525474" /></a><br /><br />On the first night I went out and passed three photographers on the beach who were quite snooty (I imagine they'd expected a quiet time on such a secluded beach). At least we don't have the American symptom of herds of photographers at key spots.<br /><br />I took a photograph of the abandoned croft house which appears at the top of this page. Unfortunately, I didn't take into account how fast the light was fading and the photo is about one to one and a half stop under exposed and appears as below (and I didn't take a second shot in order to prevent spousal retribution). I need to take a reference light check just before exposing the shot (or get a bit faster at reading exposure levels).<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rx0n88GPeqI/AAAAAAAAAHg/EMsgYkocZXY/s1600-h/IMG_49421.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rx0n88GPeqI/AAAAAAAAAHg/EMsgYkocZXY/s400/IMG_49421.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5124295878895434402" /></a><br /><br /><br />I took a photograph out of the window in the morning to show the view however. If anybody is interested in staying in this accomodation, the website is <a href="http://www.gael.net/pierhouse/">here</a>, the prices are very reasonable and you get free, fresh lobster, prawns and fish as the owners own a fleet of fishing boats.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rx0rVcGPesI/AAAAAAAAAHw/YDYzaQ3fnbc/s1600-h/IMG_51261.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rx0rVcGPesI/AAAAAAAAAHw/YDYzaQ3fnbc/s400/IMG_51261.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5124299598337112770" /></a>

Richard Childs is a professional landscape photographer, and a very hard working, talented one at that. I met Richard during the Hebrides Light and Land course where he was assisting David Ward and he brought some pictures along which were instrumental in inspiring me to move to Large Format(tm). When we planned the holiday in Scotland and realised it would be good to stop off somewhere on the way up it allowed to me to spend more than a passing visit to his gallery in Oban. <br /><br />I asked if he could provide some tuition on the Ebony in preparation for the holiday and he said we should go out an take some photographs near Oban. <br /><br />The gallery is a real gem and is an upstairs room on the main road in Oban. If he can get the downstairs room which has a main street frontage, he will have something very unique in many UK holiday resorts (a 'tourist' gallery that actually has good art in it). Richard's pictures are nearly all Ilfochrome enlargements of his 4x5 transparencies and are really worth seeing in the flesh to appreciate them.<br /><br />We sat and chatted about where I might be developing bad habits and mostly discussed exposure but also some focussing, then we went out to Port A'Mhuillin, Isle of Seil where there were some fabulous slate and granite outcroppings with a great view over Easdale. The main picture is a digital version of the LF shot I took which has come back exposed almost identically (although I had to pull it by half a stop on the LF shot due to my inability to read a watch, reading 40 seconds as 80 seconds. The good news is that it could probably cope with half a stop more exposure anyway). Richard gave me an old Velvia RVP to try alongside my new Velvia which I will be sending for processing next week.<br /><br />The other shot is looking over towards Scarba with the last of the live thrift in the foreground. I would highly recommend Richard as a good lead on a photography trip and a wonderful host in his studio. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RxvPrMGPelI/AAAAAAAAAG8/g4vJjbXFy8c/s1600-h/IMG_49371.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RxvPrMGPelI/AAAAAAAAAG8/g4vJjbXFy8c/s400/IMG_49371.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5123917341952801362" /></a>

We drive over to Ingleton and as we drove into Ingleton at 7am the sky was intense in it's Magenta/Pinkness. The clouds were that settled rounded semi-thundertop shape that you only see in a morning and the valley was shrouded in mist. Unfortunately, it all went wrong about 20 mins later - just as we got to the start of our walk. <br /><br />This sort of thing used to frustrate the hell out of me but it's almost inevitably going to happen so it's better to be prepared than it is to get stressed. This time I didn't fancy getting Charlotte to stop for a 20 minute shot before we'd even got to the walk so I let it go, hoping that the light would remain. However, the walk was strenuous and intersting, up over Twistleton to get some blood flowing and then around the whole of the Waterfall route. <br /><br />The right hand route down by Bezeley Falls was fantastic and that whole stretch was beautiful. Unfortunately the return trek cost us &#163;8 and was like the M25 on a Friday Afternoon. I was hoping to use one of the new lenses but there were so many people around Thornton Force that I needed the 210 to make sure they were out of frame. <br /><br />I've got the checklists printed out now and they proved very useful in recording my metering and I took a frame of new Velvia 50 and a frame of Velvia 100. As usual I took a digital shot immediatley after to see if I got my metering anywhere near OK.. Boring light but it's more practise for when the light is good.<br /><br />I also took a shot of Bezeley Falls with the 5D only (see below)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RvWJwsGPejI/AAAAAAAAAGs/-2HPmekHsxI/s1600-h/IMG_4903-Edit1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RvWJwsGPejI/AAAAAAAAAGs/-2HPmekHsxI/s400/IMG_4903-Edit1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5113144421513132594" /></a>

They are tiny little lenses (well, the 110 is slightly bigger than tiny but still smaller than any of my old Canon L's).<br /><br />I'll be walking the Ingleton waterfall trail tomorrow so should get an opportunity to try them out. I'll take some digitals along the way for a record. <br /><br />In the meantime here is another picture from the Lakes walk to Stickle Tarn last week.

Well, it would have been loveley had I not been hideously unfit and carrying a 50lb rucksack.<br /><br />Despite my moaning however, I loved the walk and we got some great views back towards Windemere and when we rose over the top we were treated to a magnificent view of Jacks Rake (which my braver friends then walked). If you look closely at the diagonal line in the following shot you might see a yellow pixel that is Paul Austin :-)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RvREP8GPehI/AAAAAAAAAGc/TGi_4BftvOE/s1600-h/IMG_4875-Edit1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RvREP8GPehI/AAAAAAAAAGc/TGi_4BftvOE/s400/IMG_4875-Edit1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5112786517593389586" /></a><br /><br />I took a couple of shots with the Large Format of just this view, hoping that I'll be able to make out my friends as more than a blurry yellow pixel.. it was a little windy so we'll see what comes of it soon :-)

I think I screwed up another shot by forgetting about the filter factor. I've made myself a checklist now so I don't forget simple things like this. I took two exposures of the subject in question anyway (see photo below) so I think I may be able to push it the 1.5 stops it needs.<br /><br />I've added all I can think of that might be important to my checklist and am still thinking about how to print this out.. I might try to get it spiral bound on stickers  so I can put the details on the quickload. Then again, it might be better just to put the number on the quickload. Any ideas?<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RtslyWIlNhI/AAAAAAAAAGM/pSO0W0HmkRA/s1600-h/QUICKEXPOSURERECORD.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RtslyWIlNhI/AAAAAAAAAGM/pSO0W0HmkRA/s400/QUICKEXPOSURERECORD.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5105716149419849234" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RtsjOWIlNeI/AAAAAAAAAF0/vPCWN_Hcrj0/s1600-h/IMG_48591.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RtsjOWIlNeI/AAAAAAAAAF0/vPCWN_Hcrj0/s400/IMG_48591.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5105713331921303010" /></a><br /><br />The Valley is a great location to take a walk is incredibly lush and green. So much so that the digital camera seems to suffer a little bit in getting a good colour reproduction (the greens seem a little too green and if you balance it, other stuff ends up too pink).<br /><br />The good news is that my extra Velcro on the BlackJacket worked a treat and I could nearly see the whole of the 80XL even with the dramatic light drop off in the corners. Some people have said that using a centre filter has a dramatic effect on the apparent ground glass brightness of this lens and personally I don't see it. The centre of the frame does get darker but it's not really significant. I think if you have a good darkcloth, focussing at f8 shouldn't really be a problem so the equivalent f6.5ish with no light fall off is pretty damn good. The above was taken at f13 but my LF shot was f22 at 10s.. This should really have been about 25 seconds but  I'll learn hopefully.<br /><br />The last photo here was a grab shot as we were passing a gate. I'm not totally sure about it but I do like the curve of the wall. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rtsj4mIlNgI/AAAAAAAAAGE/gn7l168lvTQ/s1600-h/IMG_48541.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rtsj4mIlNgI/AAAAAAAAAGE/gn7l168lvTQ/s400/IMG_48541.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5105714057770776066" /></a>

I'm still very happy with the BlackJacket apart from one or two things. The first is that it's just slightly too small for the Ebony. However, I've managed to work around this by putting the neck of the BJ around the bellows.. It doesn't push the bellows much and can be loosened off. This allows easy access to the knobs for back tilt and rise and will allow the back to rise to it's full extent. It also means it's easy to use even when the rear standard is not extended at all. <br /><br />The only problem now arises in that the velcro on the inside of the black jacket is not underneath the camera and so the Black Bag won't attach. I've added my own pieces of velcro and the end result is a very light tight view. There is a little light that is passing in on the left and right hand sides but I think the judicious sewing in of a couple of pieces of black felt will solve these and leave me with as dark a view as possible without adding considerable weight.<br /><br />My advice for anyone getting the BlackJacket for their ebony is to buy the larger version unless they don't mind a bit of customisation. If anybody wants a picture of how it all fits, just leave me a comment and I will add one.

It has produced some amazing pictures and will enlarge to 16x20 if I'm happy to sacrifice dpi (I think it's about 160dpi for a 16x20) but will enlarge to 10x16 at a resolution most people wouldn't notice was a compromise. So it's still going to be a tool in my arsenal but I also want it to play double duty if possible. So I've bought a set of  focussing screens for my 5D that mask out the sides of the viewfinder to give a 4x5 ratio (there is a square one  if I ever feel that Charlie Waite urge).<br /><br />This makes my 24-105 lens on the 5D a very good finder for 110-400mm large format. If I ever want to go smaller I'd get the 17-40 (Which is still under consideration but to do so I'd have to sell my 24 Tilt Shift and at the moment I'm still unsure how much I'm going to use it.. If I don't use the 24 then it will get traded in for a 17-40).<br /><br />So the 5D becomes a functional finder and scouting tool. But can it do any more? Well I figured it would be very good at giving me an indication of exposure range and to give me an idea of what to expect if I take a large format shot. In order to do this, I need to take into account a couple of details. The first is that the Canon has a large dynamic range than the transparency film. So in order to get a good assessment of highlights and shadows I need to make two exposures. The first exposure should be taken at the reading you are going to use on the LF camera (i.e. whatever you've read with the light meter). This will give you a good indication of whether you are going to blow any highlights. The second exposure should be taken 1.5 stops below (or 1.333 which works better for digital camera 1/3 stops). This will now give you a good idea of where shadows will be blocking up. <br /><br />One thing to bear in mind whilst you are doing this is that the histogram and the preview on the back of the 5D use the settings you have entered for your jpg view (i.e. if you've set the camera for high contrast, the meter will reflect this.) So if you want to have an accurate histogram that will reflect the contents of your raw file, then don't play with the contrast setting. However, if you want to emulate transparency film, setting the contrast as maximum does a fairly good visual approximation of what to expect.<br /><br />I think I'm heading towards a situation where I will be using the 5D as an exposure meter to support my spot meter readings. I also think I may end up using the 5D as a a full exposure meter but not using the internal meter, just looking at the results on the back of the camera. I have a feeling that this will be a LOT faster and more accurate than taking the equivalent readings with a spot meter (when I say more accurate, I don't mean the individual light meter readings, for which I imagine the dedicate light meter will be better, but I mean the accuracy of the overall exposure).<br /><br />Time will tell with this one and for the near future I plan to use the spot meter and then check the results I get on the 5D. The 5D will also then give me a good 'scrap book' picture to represent the results of the Large Format.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">addendum:</span> Using the 5D as a meter doesn't really work unless you can mount the SLR on the same tripod so you can see the result as you are looking.

This is partly motivated by money and partly motivated by my desire to 'do everything' if possible. There is also a little bit of "I don't trust the UK mail system not to screw up when I send my best shot yet out", which is likely to happen if I'm sending out to develop and then possibly to push and then to scan. <br /><br />So, developing yourself when your wife has already said you can't have a dark room sounds like a challenge. Fortunately it's one that had been solved many moons ago. And moon is quite appropriate word considering that the main company who deals with developing supplied the equipment to process the moon landing photographs (my god, imagine being the techy asked to process those!). Jobo have a range of processing options, of which I used to use the simple drum processing for B&W when I was a kid.<br /><br />However, with lots of film processing labs shutting down, some equipment is going cheap. I was originally looking at the Jobo CPP processing bath and had researched it and seen prices of about 500-700 pounds for a full kit second hand. However, discussing this with Baxter raised the possibility of getting one of the fully automated units which are now changing hands for &#163;300-&#163;400. The photograph above shows a Jobo ATL 2300 which is a fully automated processing unit that would fit comfortably in our garage (it's only 22" deep - thanks for the measurement Baxter).<br /><br />This would mean that processing would come down to 50p per sheet (and no surcharge for pushing). Lets say I take 30 pictures per month and that half of these I take a spare to possibly push. Thats 45x12 = ~500 shots per year. If I want to have a basic scan of half of these and a proper scan of 20 of them this would end up costing 250*&#163;2 + 50*&#163;2.50 = &#163;625 (processing and pushing a few) plus 250*&#163;6 = (&#163;1500) plus 20*12 = &#163;240 for a total of &#163;2365 not including postage. So we could say &#163;1900. <br /><br />If I do my own scanning and developing, this would be 300*0.5 = &#163;150. This seems to be a no brainer to me.. It would also mean I could now take a LOT more pictures and hence would learn a lot faster too..<br /><br />Even if I say I only take 10 pictures a month and always take a spare (if I only take this many I want to get them right). This is 120*2 + 60*2.50 = &#163;400 for processing (plus 80 for postage over the year maybe). And if I develop myself I get 180*0.5 = &#163;90. Saving &#163;400 per year on developing.. <br /><br />If I wanted these scanned it would cost 120*6 and maybe 10*12 = &#163;840... phenomenally expensive.. So even at a conservative estimate I'll be spending &#163;1500 per year on film, developing and materials instead of &#163;90 if I get the developer and scanner (with an up front cost of approx &#163;1500).<br /><br />So the next step is to try to find a good second hand ATL 2400 and the money up front to purchase.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.jobo.com/jobolab/produkte/images/223.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px;" src="http://www.jobo.com/jobolab/produkte/images/223.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

Four of my photos (which you can see elsewhere on this blog) are being exhibited at Three Albion Place in Leeds alongside a collection of Ashley Jackson's exhibition pieces, some of Joe Cornish's North Yorkshire photographs and Graham Ibbeson's recent bronzes. In fact I feel a little embarrassed about it in some ways as I don't feel I yet deserve the company but it is great to be able to see my pictures printed big (16x20s framed up with a 6 inch 3 ply matt). It took a very tiring Saturday to get everything printed and framed but it's proved to myself that I can get 'volume' if I need to (although 4 pictures a day is pretty slow to a lot of people I imagine). <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RtiLD2IlNXI/AAAAAAAAAE8/7r_sgPWlsJk/s1600-h/IMG_48111.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RtiLD2IlNXI/AAAAAAAAAE8/7r_sgPWlsJk/s400/IMG_48111.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5104983075811833202" /></a><br /><br />At the moment, the pictures are mostly my Hebrides ones, although I do have a Nidderdale picture. I will have to work hard to get some more Yorkshire pictures so I can keep the Theme.

The weather wasn't particularly nice, the sun only came out to play about 10.30 which is just as we were getting back to the car but we had a nice of about 6 miles, if a little wet. <br /><br />At the end of the walk I got my camera out and spent 20 minutes taking a picture (which you can see my digital snapshot of above). The good thing that came out of this is learning the lesson of always setting everything to zero before taking a picture. After being back for 2 days, I was testing my light metering and noticed it was still on +3.5 filter factor from my "Door" shot. Doh! Anyway, the good news is that I won't make that mistake again quite so quickly next time.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rtl_z2IlNdI/AAAAAAAAAFs/japUj7tBwXc/s1600-h/IMG_47791.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rtl_z2IlNdI/AAAAAAAAAFs/japUj7tBwXc/s400/IMG_47791.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5105252181282731474" /></a><br /><br />The picture needed better light to work well anyway (as you can see above). I've also added a picture of the view into Goredale scar.. This could also be very nice given the right light.

I had already sort of accepted that the processing of transparencies was expensive but not too bad at &#163;2 per shot (or &#163;3 if you want to push process) but when I looked at getting a decent scan done that I could blow up to 16x20+ I was horrified to find it would cost between &#163;8 and &#163;12 per shot (and that done on an Imacon). If I wanted a drum scan, the costs jump to &#163;10-&#163;20 which is a hell of a lot of money. I can understand the pricing reflects the time involved up to a point and there is little demand for a professional service but if I end up taking 50 pictures over a year that would be &#163;500-&#163;1,000. <br /><br />So, I looked around at the possibility of buying a scanner and seeing if the 'semi-pro' scanners were suitable. The Epson 750 looked like a good prospect but looking closeley, they aren't even close to the imacon, which seemed to be the only afforable alternative (and one that both Joe Cornish and Baxter Bradford are familiar with and recommend). However... I was browsing on the http://lf-photo.org.uk and saw this <a href="http://www.lf-photo.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=343&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">thread</a  > and started looking into second hand drum scanners.. The screenshot you can see at the top of the article convinced me there was something in the Howtek's and I contacted Pete Slynn at <a href="http://www.pselectronics.co.uk/">PS Electronics</a> and he said that they have Howtek 4500's for less than a thousand pounds. Well this sounds very attractive so once I get the available cash it could be worth and investment.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.joy.org.uk/stuff/.scanner/scanner-comparison.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.joy.org.uk/stuff/.scanner/scanner-comparison.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

After speaking with a fellow named Baxter Bradford, who I emailed because he also uses the 80XL and one of the Robert White chaps said he had solved the problem with an extra back, he said the purchase of the extra back with a wide angle fresnel solved the problem completely. <br /><br />However I was also chatting with Bill Maxwell of Maxwell Precision Optics. He produces custom fresnels that have a greater brightness than the standard fresnels in many cameras. The general online consensus is that it is the best replacement ground glass/fresnel on the market (although it is expensive and I imagine there may be a little bit of post purchase justification going on). Bill can supply an extra wide angle fresnel that starts working at around 90mm and will show the corners of a 58 lens with no light fall off. The only downside is that he has to fit it to the back himself (or get an engineer to do so). I've spoken to him about what actual works needs to be done to get it to fit but had no reply yet.<br /><br />I will most likely be ordering an extra back for my Ebony with the stock wide angle fresnel. At some point I will order the Maxwell standard fresnel and based on the performance of that and how much machining work needs to be done for the extra wide, I may also purchase that. The Maxwell gg/fresnel is about &#163;150.<br /><br />I was also out near Sutton Bank in North Yorkshire this week just before a meeting with our chairman and myself and my dear wife went for a little walk in the woods and I took the photo you see above. Charlotte also took a photograph of me looking like something steampunk from Naked Lunch.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RtiIaGIlNVI/AAAAAAAAAEs/rwEd3KWuYkk/s1600-h/IMG_47671.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RtiIaGIlNVI/AAAAAAAAAEs/rwEd3KWuYkk/s400/IMG_47671.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5104980159529039186" /></a>

I did receive my new Schneider 80XL Super Symmar though only to realise I didn't have a lens board for a Copal 0 shutter. The lens is beautiful though, very light indeed. The other problem was the filter size, which is normally 67mm but with the IIIb centre filter is 88mm which means the normal Lee filter adapters don't fit. So, another order to Robert White goes in for an Ebony lens board and a Lee push on adapter with donut spacer. Oh, and while I'm at it I thought I'd order the lens shade clip so I have somewhere to put my ground glass protector. <br /><br />The next day not only do all of these extra items arrive but so does my BlackJacket. Very good timing as I get to try out the BlackJacket at the same time as the 80XL, which probably needs it. As it turns out, the BlackJacket is fabulous, it's a cunning design that is made of a material that feels heavy but is in fact quite light. A great combination when it's hanging on your head (it means it drapes nicely and isn't affected by the wind much). The 32" actually does fit over the ebony back, including the rear standard base, although it is quite tight. The gap below the rear standard and the base is covered by the bag that the BlackJacket comes in (see the website for more details). <br /><br />Mounting the 80XL onto the lens board was a little fraught, although Robert White kindly helped me with simple instructions. They told me one of the critical things which is to remove the grub screw on the front element. They also said that the lens only needs finger tightening up (using two fingernails). <br /><br />Onto the 80XL. Well, first thing is that it's not like the 210 symmar where you have a great clear picture that is equal intensity all over the ground glass. There is quite a lot of light fall off that I think is probably normal for a wide angle lens but makes it somewhat difficult to see the whole of the picture in one go. If you look straight one, you can see a 'hot' centre spot and the edges are very dark. As you move your head around you get to see the edges better. I'll have to compare this with other lenses to see if it's normal. The edges of the 80 are also quite soft at 4.5 although this does sharpen up nicely by f8. You can focus OK at f4.5 but the picture doesn't snap into focus like the 210 Symmar S. I had a chat with Joe Cornish about it and he said he uses a wide angle fresnel. Robert White also said that Baxter Bradford bought a wide angle fresnel with a new back plate so he could swap easily. I've spoken to Maxwell screens about a possible replacement but I'll focus on getting  the basics sorted before I start straying into new screens :-)<br /><br />The lens shade clip is a neat device, if a little strange to work with. The one thing I had to do was to stick some foam in the mouth of the clip so it would hold onto the plate better (foam tape is useful for this and many other applications, like stopping your glass protector from rattling).<br /><br />Finally, the push on filter holder from Lee is a nice bit of kit but I'm now unable to use the polariser whilst using this, although I probably shouldn't be using it at this wide angle anyway, we'll see. I think I probably won't use the centre filter with the 110XL anyway. If needs be, I'll have to look at getting a dedicated polariser for the push on mount.<br /><br />I'll hopefully be getting out with the 80 at the weekend.

The photograph was taken f16 @ 1/2 sec but I think I screwed it up slightly. I used a 2 stop hard grad over the door and below in order to try to get more detail into the tree shadows above. I originally was going to place the door on zone V but I figured it's actually quite dark wood so I decided I'd like to place the wall stone on zone V instead. Then I took the readings and it said to use 0.7 of a second but the closest I could get was 0.5. This meant I'd actually place the wall on zone IV and a half, meaning most of the picture was low key. This might turn out quite 'rich' but I have a feeling it will probably just look underexposed. I realise now that I should be using the f stop in order to achieve 1/3 stop increments. <br /><br />Anyway, as usual I took a post exposure 35mm shot at 24mm (which seemed a fairly close match to the 80mm.

I got to show David Ward his new website yesterday and he seemed quite happy with the way it was all coming together (although I think he was dreading the amount of writing he was going to have to do on top of finishing his new book). I wrote a new feature for the site that inverts the view from a black background (good for pictures) to a white background (good for reading text) which went down well. Although it seems a little gimmicky it's actually really nice to be able to switch.<br /><br />I was quite worried about showing him the pictures I'd added of his as part of the process involved rating the images (for various ordering algorithms). Obviously going through and rating the whole of someones portfolio is a little cheeky to say the least but I think I didn't make too many faux pas (like ranking his favourite photo 'null points' for instance).<br /><br />Hopefully well get a site launch in the next month or so.

Sitting on my stool with the large format in front of me reminded me of fishing in some ways, and the comparison is not that far off when you think about it. I got the chance to actually spend some time on the shot and took my exposure readings using the spot meter (one for highlights, one for shadows and one for a guessed midtone). I then checked the difference between the highlight and my midtone and worked out what stop grad I would need. Also from this I could work out what areas would end up too dark. After taking the shot, I took the same shot with my 5D and checked the results. I have a feeling the frame will be too dark but we can check later. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RreJEh-QM8I/AAAAAAAAAD8/RqtI7JlqH50/s1600-h/IMG_47501.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RreJEh-QM8I/AAAAAAAAAD8/RqtI7JlqH50/s400/IMG_47501.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5095692214324966338" /></a><br /><br /><br />After this I walked back and stopped in the middle of a field to take a shot of a line of trees with sunset lit clouds above them. The white in the clouds is really bright (about a stop more than the blue of the sky) and I think I might have cooked the shot again. Surprisingly, I could quite happily see the shot on the back of the ground glass without the dark cloth (even more so when using the loupe). This was sufficient to frame and check the focus. <br /><br />The ballhead I'm using works particularly well with a heavier camera on it. It's a Really Right Stuff BH55 and has a very functional tension control that you can set to not allow the camera to 'flop' but still allow you to move the camera around to frame. The 'lock' is particularly strong also. <br /><br />The pictures I've attached are the ones that were taken with my 5D at the same settings as the camera (but only done after I'd worked everything out so I can see my mistakes quickly!). I've not been too concerned with composition and subject in these photographs, I'm mostly trying to learn the camera (although thats not much excuse for crap photography).

On the way up we saw quite a few flying ants and as we approached the ridge the ground was teeming with them. Not to be deterred, we setup at the top of the ridge and I went ahead and set up for a photograph. I'm still paranoid at the chance of the tripod falling over and add to that my inexperience, the whole process was a little fraught (including the 100ft drop 2ft to my left). I decided to use the Acros black and white film to begin with and tested my exposure settings on the 5D which seemed to be OK. Apart from forgetting to lift the darkslide everything went OK. There appeared to be a lot more insects flying around though. We decided to head down to the bottom of the bank where there is an old quarry area with pine trees and cotton grass but stopped on the way to take a photograph looking down the river. At this point the wind dropped and obviously this was the only thing holding back the bugs. I have never seen so many insects in my life, At one point I had my head in the dark cloth and was accompanied by over 10 that I could see. And these were starting to bite. This, and the heat inside my dark cloth, added to the levels of frustration and after I accidentally forgot to close the shutter on one slide of Velvia 100 I gave up. We tried stopping again on the way back to the car but the midges were everywhere now. Charlotte ended up with over 30 bites and I've got a few here and there.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RreK-x-QM-I/AAAAAAAAAEM/7Xqv3KnM03A/s1600-h/IMG_47401.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RreK-x-QM-I/AAAAAAAAAEM/7Xqv3KnM03A/s400/IMG_47401.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5095694314563974114" /></a><br /><br />The big lessons learned were that you have to have a check list in your head. If you don't, things will go wrong. The second thing was that there are lots of things that have to be put away whilst you are taking a shot (loupe, darkcloth, filmholder, film, lenscover, rearplate, ) and it would be nice to have somewhere to put some of them. To this end I've ordered the Gnass quick load holder (as seen in the Dykinga book). I also need to get better at 'seeing' upside down. At the moment I found it difficult to locate a crop that I'd seen with my eyes (or camera). This will come with practise I think. Finally, working with a view camera is a bugger for your back and I think I'll have to either get the tripod working higher up or sit down to take the photographs (I broke my back 10 years ago and have three vertebrae fused together and two mashed discs - generally OK but bending over very slightly is one of the worst positions).

As always, Joe's pictures inspire although I was dissapointed that there weren't more of his Time to Wonder pictures on the walls. This was because Steve Lewis' exhibition had opened the night before. I like a lot of Steve's pictures, particularly <a href="http://www.landscapesofwales.co.uk/water/water-5.html">this image of Afon Conwy in Wales</a>. Wales is a much undiscovered country for landscape photography (apart from the Gower and Snowdonia) and it's nice to see some unique images of such unspoilt areas. <br /><br />Joe was just taking a group of people out on a one day workshop but stopped for a chat and was pleased to hear of another Ebony convert. He also recommended <a href="http://www.npsmedia.com/">NPS Media</a> for E6 processing. Anyway, we asked at reception where local would be good to take my camera and Liz recommended Aysgarth falls or Sutton bank. We figured Sutton Bank would need low light to work well and so went to Aysgarth and were treated to drizzle, drizzle and more drizzle. The drive over was quite exciting however. There were many locations and great old farm buildings (one particular one with a tree sticking out of it's roof!).<br /><br />So we returned home slightly despondent and swore to get out today, which, touch wood, is beginning to look pretty nice. <br /><br />I was also looking around for reciprocity times yesterday and discovered <a href="http://www.stevegoslingphotography.co.uk/landscapes3.htm">Steve Gosling's pinhole photography</a> using <a href="http://www.zeroimage.com/web2003/EntryPage/entryFrameset.htm">Zero Image</a> cameras (found via Zero Image site, which was found via <a href="http://howardgrill.blogspot.com/">Motivation. Images, Ideas, and Thoughts About Photography</a>. Although I had seen his pictures previously I hadn't paid attention to the black and white material. These pictures have a beautiful aura and are well worth looking at.<br /><br />The pictures I've attached are of my new home made dark cloth (sewing machine guidance from Charlotte).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWp1x-QMmI/AAAAAAAAABM/jWB_PxqdLFo/s1600-h/IMG_47391.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWp1x-QMmI/AAAAAAAAABM/jWB_PxqdLFo/s400/IMG_47391.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5095165294852190818" /></a>

Swapping the screens over was dead simple and working with a 5x4 crop on the 5D is wierd but strangely pleasing.<br /><br />After playing around with compositions using the Ebony the night before, I realised quite how scary it is to tip the whole camera over whilst you are trying to find yourself good camera positions. To this end, the 5D is now going to lay an extended Large Format support role in that it will be use to do the initial scoping of shots and also be used whilst getting the camera/tripod into a good starting position. I've been reading about some people using the 5D as a metering tool but I think I'd still like to use the spot meter (Although a combination of the both might be interesting, I'll have to think about that). <br /><br />Jeremy was a great guy and I'll be working with him on the development of an online gallery webiste system to promote and provide central, audited print & framing services for photographers who would typically not get that type of exposure. I showed him the new David Ward site (which now has full checkout built in) and he was suitably impressed. Especially with the 'invert' button; although he did prefer white on black apart from the blog and article pages.<br /><br />As the evening wears on I'm receiving my wifes tuition in sewing so I can make my own simple dark cloth using some off cuts of synthetic crushed velvet which means we should be out taking photographs sometime tomorrow. I'll get some pictures of the final item tomorrow.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWpIB-QMlI/AAAAAAAAABE/D0eDnx7xhDw/s1600-h/IMG_47361.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWpIB-QMlI/AAAAAAAAABE/D0eDnx7xhDw/s400/IMG_47361.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5095164508873175634" /></a>

It arrived this morning and a quick check showed that it was all working well, if a little sturdier (tighter) that the one I had first. This evening Charlotte asked if I would like her to make a dark cloth for me out of some lightweight synthetic velvet she has left over. Obviously I can't turn down a great offer like this and so we designed a small, tube based dark cloth with a single hole for access to the ground glass. I'll get a photo together when we make it up tomorrow night. In the meantime, I've been back on the website for David Ward and adding a simple sales enquiry system to the site. This should allow customers to put together an order for framed, unframed or card style pictures and for it to be manageable using the administration system.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWwoR-QM5I/AAAAAAAAADk/k21Oi7R9-T0/s1600-h/IMG_34761.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWwoR-QM5I/AAAAAAAAADk/k21Oi7R9-T0/s400/IMG_34761.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5095172759505351570" /></a><br />I also spent some time reading an excellent thread about contemplation in large format photography which I found through the <a href="http://photomusings.wordpress.com/2007/03/28/contemplation/">'Contemplate - Musings on Photography' website</a>. My take on this is that any format can be used to get to the area of the photograph, but it's very difficult to make an accurate composition on the viewfinder of most SLRs - not impossible though. The ground glass of a large format camera gives the photographer a real window into the picture they are capturing. The fact that it's a different, slower process is just something that can nudge people into a different way of taking.

I don't feel so sad as I'm still waiting for the my BlackJacket and it should be back for the weekend (crossed fingers). If it is back, I'm planning on taking at least 5 shots each of the Fuji Velvia abd the Fuji Acros that I got with the Quickload back. This should get me over the 'fear'. I also ordered a Canon 'Black Mask' focusing screen from Calumet America. As I'll be using the 5D predominantly as a hand held 4x5 camera for finding shots and getting shots that I couldn't with the Ebony, this mask will be very useful in ensuring I know what the crop ratio is. Hopefully this will arrive early next week. <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWwTB-QM3I/AAAAAAAAADU/r7utcEL4HoA/s1600-h/IMG_38471.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWwTB-QM3I/AAAAAAAAADU/r7utcEL4HoA/s400/IMG_38471.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5095172394433131378" /></a><br />One of the things I plan to do in order to be more open about my photography is to publish every image I take with the large format camera. This will mean that I can't hide behind the volume of shots I take and that if there are any lessons to be learned from my mistakes, they will be very obvious. I intend to have multiple parts to my gallery pages that can be filtered to show 'best', 'all' and 'include screw ups' filters. I have thought about buying a small voice recorder to keep a record of all of the details of my photographs. I'll continue thinking for now but in the meantime I bought a Moleskin (old school) and 2B pencil will have to do.

The Arca Swiss plate from Really Right Stuff arrived today and is a great fit for the camera. I also phoned Robert White today about the eccentricity on the focus knob. They  were very nice about it and are arranging a pick up to replace it with another 45SU that they have in stock. They agreed with my assessment that if it's received a knock, who knows what else may have been rearranged. So I'll be back without the camera for a few days (and the weather so good too). Ah well, I don't have my BlackJacket yet so I can't photograph in earnest. The truth is that I have a nervous feeling about taking a photograph with the camera. There is a lack of risk associated with digital that means you don't have worries about screwing up. The mindset now is more 'I must not make a mistake'. At the end of the day, a mistake just costs some money now, wheras it didn't before. The other thing is that mistakes become a LOT more obvious. Wheras I would filter my 800 photos down to 10 good ones (if I'm lucky), I now have to take 10 good ones. This brings up all sorts of doubts about how good I actually am. I'm sure once I've gone through 10 frames and sent them to be processed, this fear will start to recede. This is one of the main reasons why I wanted to keep the digital camera, so I could still experiment and take risks. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rq5tQx-QMjI/AAAAAAAAAA0/86wqQTu-WuU/s1600-h/IMG_47231.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rq5tQx-QMjI/AAAAAAAAAA0/86wqQTu-WuU/s400/IMG_47231.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093128363662389810" /></a><br /><br />Anyway, with the goal of getting to know the camera a little better, I took it out into the garden today to play around a little. Firstly taking a (virtual) photo of the setting sun and getting good scheimpflug on the fence and trees, also playing with aperture and depth of field. I can still see a reasonable picture to focus at f16. Next I thought I'd see how close I could focus. With full bellows extension, I could get to within a meter of the flowers in the picture with my 210 Symmar S. Also the Symmar S has a HUGE image circle (at least I couldn't get to the edges of it).<br /><br />I then played around with lining up next to a wall for swing and taking a shot next to the ground for extreme front and rear tilt (almost horizontal plane of focus). It was strange to watch the focus move from the base of the blades of grass to the tips all the way across the lawn from my tripod to 20ft away.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rq5tZR-QMkI/AAAAAAAAAA8/xoKieoLpHsA/s1600-h/IMG_47281.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rq5tZR-QMkI/AAAAAAAAAA8/xoKieoLpHsA/s400/IMG_47281.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093128509691277890" /></a><br /><br />Here is a photo of my current bag layout.

Well it's been unpacked and although I can't actually play with it properly (no Arca Swiss mount yet) I have been trying it outside in the sunshine. First comment it, working on a ground glass large screen is astonishing.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rq5pph-QMgI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Qop_O1bOCcU/s1600-h/IMG_47241.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rq5pph-QMgI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Qop_O1bOCcU/s400/IMG_47241.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093124390817640962" /></a><br /><br />You can actually see the details of the picture. The default '3D' effect is something that is a little unnerving and something I will have to be very wary of when composing. I'm worried that our brains are so hard wired to recognise the 3D edges of things that I will find compositions that are based on this effect. It's the classic symptom of wandering around a wood and thinking 'this would make a fantastic photograph' and then the actual photo is a jumble. All of the information was in the 3D edges of the trees and branches and the receeding lines were all in your head and not actually on the ground glass. Anyway, the usual trick in these cases is to just close an eye to get the 'flat' effect. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rq5p2h-QMhI/AAAAAAAAAAk/G9RjlNk6WwE/s1600-h/IMG_47271.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rq5p2h-QMhI/AAAAAAAAAAk/G9RjlNk6WwE/s400/IMG_47271.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093124614155940370" /></a><br /><br /><br />The Schneider loupe is very good, I can focus as accurately as I can set the knobs. The assymetrical tilt makes it very easy to set up complex scheimpflug configurations (as long as you have something on the 1/3 line). I've obviously yet to compose in earnest so we'll see what happens. A nice feature of the Schneider loupe is a rubber neckstrap with quick release ends. I'm going to have to take a photograph of these to show what I mean. A nice design touch.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rq5p-x-QMiI/AAAAAAAAAAs/Bqsoih6ugwU/s1600-h/IMG_47301.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/Rq5p-x-QMiI/AAAAAAAAAAs/Bqsoih6ugwU/s400/IMG_47301.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093124755889861154" /></a><br /><br /><br />One downer is that one of the knobs has been attached slightly at an angle. This means it wobbles as it rotates. Although this is not affecting the camera as far as I can tell, I will be contacting Robert White to ask their advice. My only worry is that the camera may have taken a knock which could affect some other aspect of operation. <br /><br />An important lesson learned about the Ebony very early on is to always screw down the rear tilt knobs before picking the camera up. If you don't do this, you pull the camera very quickly into a full rear rise. If you've got no bellows extension this looks like it could damage the bellows. I've been caught out by this one twice but luckily stopped before I pulled up too far. <br /><br />Another interesting observation is the the base extension knob locking wheels don't rotate along with the main knobs. Sometimes causing the bed to lock itself up. This is not a problem once you've noticed what is happening.<br /><br />Overall my impression is of a very workmanlike tool. It is by no means a delicate work of art. I would have been a lot happier had I received a manual with the camera but I think I've read around enough to know what most things are doing. I'll try to write my own guide to the operation of the camera sometime soon. Hopefully I'll be out taking photos before then.

I have to say that I was a bit dissapointed. The majority of the exhibition was small items and photographs of old work. Some of the older work is interesting to see to put his early work into context but the only item that stood out was a submerged wall in a lake with a dam. Unfortunately they only had a couple of photographs of it.<br /><br />We went across to the other side of the park (3km) only to find out that the other gallery shuts at 4pm (not notices anywhere say this and there was a queue of people who had walked across who had to turn back). We did see the 'hanging trees' which were interesting pieces but they don't have the resonance of the other sinuous stone wall peices or his natural constructions. His most recent work seems a lot more brutal and lacks the empathy that I see in his 'well known' work.

It came in a very nice silver embossed cardboard box and had no manual. So the first thing I did was to extend the bed using the right hand side geared wheels. Very smooth action but then got stuck. I discovered that this is because on the left hand side, the locking nuts were rotating with the geared axle, causing the geared motion to lock the bed too. When I loosened these off all was fine. The next step was to try it with lens on. I put the Symmar S 210 on and put the whole beast on the dining room table and looked into the ground glass. WOW.. The image looks very 3D. In fact it looks so 3D I had to close one eye to find out why. The answer is that it is 3D, each eye sees a slightly different image and there is a definite sense of depth in the picture. This could be disconcerting when composing as it creates form in the image that won't be shown in the final picture. OK, so I'll be closing one eye to check final composition :-). The Schneider 4x loupe also arrived and it was a lot bigger than I expected. the front opening is about an inch across. Saying that, the picture shown is perfect for focus. The ground glass grain is only just visible and I can see more focus detail than I can probably focus accurately with the geared knobs. I showed the whole thing to Charlotte and she said "Why is it upside down?", but apart from this philistine comment she was appropriately impressed. I also tried so rear tilt in order to show Charlotte the focussing abilities (it seems she is being asked why is Tim going back to using a film camera, and a victorian "head in bag" one at that). Just a quick check to see if the camera will fit in my photo bag (Lowerpro Pro Trekker II) and it does, with a lens on to boot. Hopefully I'll get the dark cloth and mount soon and I can take it out for a test run!

Pay day was yesterday and within seconds of seeing my pay cheque hit the bank, the order was in with Ken from Robert White. He also was very kind enough to find my a rear lens cap for my cheap Symmar S. So sometime today (hopefully) a 45SU, Schneider 4x loupe and cable release should be arriving. At this point I'm going to be very excited and put it all together and have that weird feeling of 'what the hell do I do now?'. Well we're off to the Yorkshire Sculpture park this afternoon and if all of the bits I need arrive (which I don't think they will, I'm still waiting for the dark cloth and the arca swiss mount from America) then I'll give it a go (much to Charlotte's embarrassment I'm sure). What will probably happen is me taking it out to the backyard and using a couple of old T-Shirts as a pseudo BlackJacket dark cloth. <br /><br />On a side note, I'm working with a colleague on a project to build a fine art gallery website and in return for some of my input, he's going to be purchasing a couple of lenses. So the final range of lenses I will have will be Schneider Super Symmar 80XL and 110XL, Rodenstock Sironar S 150, Fujinon A 240 and 300. The Symmar S will likely be donated to somebody on the Gower course next year.

I'm also working on a generic fine art gallery for a colleague. During this process, the inevitable conversation about protecting images came up, as mentioned in a previous post. Over the last couple of days, I've worked on a plug-in for the image processing module of the website that will allow some extra flexibility in protecting images. This topic was discussed to death on The Online Photographer website. His conclusion was very close to mine and that is that, without completeley disfigouring your photograph, you can't stop people using it illegally unless you remove it from the internet completely. So, if you want to show your pictures, it's more important to make people aware that they are copyright and that the user should license them for use. My solution to this is to write a plug-in that appends a panel below a photograph if it is displayed above a certain size. This panel can have a background colour to match the website and so it won't look like part of the photograph until someone decides to save it or use the photograph out of context. The information in the bottom panel should provide the copyright mark and information on how to contact the photographer and a link to the website where prominent licensing information can be found.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWuwR-QMxI/AAAAAAAAACk/6uHOp8j8dcE/s1600-h/Parkin_20061025_1006-11.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWuwR-QMxI/AAAAAAAAACk/6uHOp8j8dcE/s400/Parkin_20061025_1006-11.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5095170697921049362" /></a><br />I'm also thinking about providing an extra feature for registered users so that they can view a higher resolution, better quality version of the photograph if they have registered their name and email address. I've added the ability to add a watermark if someone really wants one, but I hope they don't.

I've got to make sure I get all of the other bits that make the camera work of which the following list is a small selection<br /><br />Tripod Mount<br />Dark Cloth<br />Loupe<br />Quick Load Back<br />Film<br />Filter Holders & Filters<br />Cable Release<br /><br />The tripod mount had to be an Arca Swiss so I could use it with my RRS BH55 Ball head. After a little research (and a failed bid on ebay for the wrong one) I found that RRS recommend the B22 for the 45SU and I ordered one on ebay two days ago (I also ordered a new L plate for my 5D that has the lug for a wrist strap. I modified my 20D RRS Plate to be able to attach a wrist strap and much preferred that setup over a neck strap).<br /><br />The Dark Cloth could be anything from an Ebony Special to the T-Shirt. I've even heard of people using dracula capes (don't worry Charlotte). On one forum I found a link to the Black Cloth which is a specialist company (individual?) from America that makes custom dark cloths made out of breathable material that is very dark and setup to allow easy access to the ground glass for focussing. Take a look at <a href="http://www.quietworks.com/FRAMES_FILES/WELCOME_BJ_FOCUSINGCLOTH.html">Black Jacket from QuietWorks</a>. Keith Walklet from QuietWorks was very helpful over email and gave me two options (after asking what specific camera the jacket was intended for). He also sent a diagram and the following text.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RqfJTR-QMeI/AAAAAAAAAAM/F0_yNtHn2og/s1600-h/BJpath45S%5B4%5B2%5D.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RqfJTR-QMeI/AAAAAAAAAAM/F0_yNtHn2og/s320/BJpath45S%5B4%5B2%5D.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5091259236844843490" /></a><br /><br /><blockquote><br />The red and blue paths would work fine with a 32" neck. They also have the advantage of not requiring the use of the BLACKBAG&#129; but face other issues:<br /><br />Excessive rear tilt may force the neck off the camera back with the red path. With the blue path, you may find that the neck gets in the way of the film holder (if you leave it on during an exposure).<br /><br />The yellow path, which includes the rear standard, would be best matched with a 40", but will require you use the BLACKBAG&#129; feature to block the light coming between the base and rear cabinet.<br /><br />So, the 40" would give you a little more flexibility on how it goes on.<br /><br />For some additional perspective on the matter, watch this video:<br /><br />http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8943086050994650067<br /><br />The video illustrates use with a monorail, but the approach with a larger neck on your camera is similar.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I went for the 32" to try to keep things neat as I like to keep things as quick as possible to setup. If I'm wrong, I'm happy to spend the money on a second one as Keith has been very helpful and charges a reasonable price for a custom product.<br /><br />Loupes come in many multipliers from 2x to 10x. I asked David Ward, Joe Cornish and Stuart from Robert White about which they would recommend and all said the 4x although it was mentioned that a 6x could be useful. Robert White recommended the Schneider loupe and also mentioned that the 6x loupe is a better optic that the 4x would be more than good enough if you eyesight was fine.<br /><br />The Fuji Quickload back seems like a standard choice and I saw one on Ebay that was selling for &#163;100 with a pack of old Velvia and a also a pack of Acros (from the same guy who sold the lens). I had to convince my wife to buy a new fridge to put it all in though (she still thinks it's for food for some reason).<br /><br />I have a lee filter set anyway although only in 0.6's and 0.9's. I need to get 0.3's and probably 0.45's before I go on holiday. David Ward also recommended the 81a, 81b and possibly an 85c depending on new Velvia reciprocity (see David's blog for a comparison between old and new Velvia).<br /><br />The final item that I nearly forgot was lens cables, which Robert White recommended the Horseman. I'll probably order the 50cm one. <br /><br />So that should be it. I'll be ordering the Camera, cable, loupe and grads/81s on Friday so we're close to beginning now :-)

I had read David Ward's photography book before going on the course so thought I knew what to expect. As it was my expectations were confounded and he turned out to be someone with whom I had a lot in common and whose work and thinking matched mine in many respects (including stuff which has no obvious link with photography such as music and reading. I'll probably contradict this later as I think both of these subjects have strong links with photography). <br /><br />David showed us some of his work whilst we were away and I was quite literally stunned at the beauty of one of them. The process of seeing this end result was one of the reasons why I came away feeling so strongly about large format, even though the reason I was stunned was more to do with composition than quality. What I was surprised at was that he didn't have any website that really did his work justice. As I also wish to build my own website, and yet never get around to it, I thought I could combine a few things together to help everybody. I could help David build a website and in the process I would build a framework for a website that I could use myself. As it is I also get the opportunity to bore David with my questions about photography too!<br /><br />The building of the website raised a few interesting points however. These ranged from the size of images to be used to the positioning and functionality of the next and previous buttons. I'll talk about a few of these points in future posts but for now I thought I'd mention the issue of the maximum image size to show potential customers.<br /><br />I have thought about this for quite a while and have found great frustration with many artists websites where their photographs are miniscule. The justification for this is so that people cannot copy or print out the work so that the photographer does not lose money.<br /><br />I find this a little difficult to understand. The thought that a person who might buy an enlargement of a large format picture would be happy with a postcard size home print is just plain wrong in my opinion. For David's site, I suggested that the pictures be available with a large dimension of 1200px, This would mean that the largest quality print that someone could make would be approx. 3 inch by 4 inch at 300dpi. They could print a postcard size print off at 6x8 inch at 150 dpi if they wanted. I can't see that people who might print off a picture such as this on their home printer are going to decide that they now do not need to purchase that 16x20 ilfochrome. <br /><br />What I can see very clearly is that some people will not buy that 16x20 ilfochrome if all they have to judge it is a 240x320px picture. These are the potential lost sales photographers should be thinking about...

Being a stubborn, non-conformist fool, I decided I'd like to work out a completely different grouping for myself. I also wanted to work out my own equivalent focal lengths as the standard multiply by three or four figures seemed odd to me.<br /><br />So we'll start with an equivalent focal length for a sample 24mm lens (for 35mm film). In my mind, when I take a photograph on 35mm and then crop to 4x5 ratio, this gives me a foundation for my equivalence. So, with width of my 4x5 cropped 35mm film is 24mm (35mm being 24mmx36mm). The with of a large format film is 4 inches or 4x25.6mm which is 102.4mm. Now this gives me a ratio of 24 to 102.4 as my EFL multiplier which is 4.267 or 0.234 depending on which way you want to work.<br /><br />So lets look at a few 35mm lenses and see what equivalents we get:-<br /><br />14  =  60<br />19  =  81<br />24  =  102<br />28  =  119<br />35  =  149<br />50  =  213<br />85  =  363<br /><br />These seem like sensible equivalents to me. The next step is to work out what spacing of lens sizes I would like. Well I do like the 18-28 region and the standard spacing between 90-150-210 works out as about roughly 40% difference between steps.<br /><br />Having a look at the lenses available and which lenses have a great reputation, I quickly found that the Rodenstock 150mm Sironar S is universally acclaimed as a large format standard. If we work with this as a starting point and work 40% down, we get to 107mm. This corresponds with a very highly acclaimed Schneider lens, the 110XL Super Symmar.  40% down again and  we get 78mm which corresponds with the matching Super Symmar XL of 80mm.<br /><br />Given these three lenses, I felt they gave a good, wide angle biased lens selection (Albeit at somewhat of a hefty price, at least for the Symmars). The 35mm equivalents for these focal lengths, 80-110-150 are 20mm, 27mm and 37mm which seem to give me a better landscape bias than 90-150-210 equivalents of  22mm, 37mm, 52mm. The bonus of the two Symmars is that they also share the same centre filter size.<br /><br />At the longer end, I have been recommended the 240 Fujinon A and the 300 Nikkor but in the short term, three lenses is more than enough to worry about.<br /><br />I messed up these plans a little by finding a very cheap Schneider Symmar S 210 on EBay for 100 pounds which I bought so that when I get the camera I will have at least one lens to test it with. This lens arrived in good condition and seems optically sound.<br /><br />The main worry I had about the above lens combination were the light falloff of the Symmars in comparison to the Super Angulons (which do clever stuff with pupil size to help with falloff) and also the reputation of the 80mm as being too soft wide open to focus. I have been told that the 80mm softness was a production issue in early lenses and that a new 80mm should not show any difficulty in focusing.

Having looked around the web, this seemed to be the 'dream camera' for a lot of people as it combined being a work of art in of itself and still was supremely functional and lightweight. The fact that it could be stored in a backpack with the lens on and I wouldn't have to play with unfolding standards seemed a large bonus. Up until going on the L&amp;L course (Large format and Light pockets course perhaps?) I was none the wiser and so when I saw the results and process and liked what I saw, I started asking questions. One of the first questions was "So what is this asymmetric back all about and do I want it?" to which the answer was mostly "You don't need it but it does make certain types of photograph a cinch to set up without having too many downsides". So this seemed a good thing.<br /><br />And then David Ward gets his Linhof Technikardan out and starts me thinking "That's a nice technical camera!". So I had a quandry, the more utilitarian camera for making photographs was the Linhof (apart from collapsing and opening it) but the beautiful camera was the Ebony. The Linhof had a larger range for telephoto shooting (the standards could extend to accomocate huge focal lengths) but the Ebony suited the wider angles well.<br /><br />Well I swung back and forth for a bit and I was also influenced by the fact that too many people have got Ebony which, for me at least, makes me not want it (call it the anti-sheep factor). In the end however, the lust for wood and metal and beauty won out. So this was a first choice mostly made.<br /><br />The second, and more difficult choice in many ways, was the lenses. I not only needed to choose which lenses, but more importantly which focal lengths. The problem I have with selecting focal lengths is that I look at a book like 'First Light' by Joe Cornish and find out that 95% of the photographs were taken with a 90mm lens. But they look to me like anywhere between 18mm to 40mm equivalents (35mm equiv, which I will refer to as EFL for equivalent focal length). One of the only really wide shots he has in the book is a 58mm which looks like a 24mm EFL. There is obviously something wierd that the camera movements can introduce into a picture that affect it's EFL look.<br /><br />The next post will go into lens choices.

The first time I considered LF was when I was looking at various blogs talking about how digital cameras could almost get a picture that was as good as medium format film. These same articles compared the best digital photos (ignoring scanning backs for the moment) with large format to show how good digital was getting. I remember thinking that the large format pictures just looked so much more real in their portrayal of texture (<a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/Cramer.shtml">Charles Cramer 4x5 vs Digital at Luminous Landscape</a>). At the time however, I remember thinking that I really liked that digital gave you a quick feedback cycle and helped to close the loop between taking and learning. However, at that time I was looking into the use of tilt shift lenses and promised myself that when I got my new digital (this was just before I'd bought the 5D) I would get a 24TSE and play with Scheimpflug. <br /><br />Since that time, I read more Joe Cornish books and found the Ebony website. This lead to much slavering. Unfortunately there was no way I could justify spending that sort of money as I'd only just got my 5D. However, the desire for the engineering that is an Ebony camera stuck with me and I'd quickly look back now and again. This also lead me to find more large format photographers and I remember at one point starting to look into how much it would actually cost to get a LF kit together. <br /><br />The final straw was seeing the prints produced by David Ward and Richard Childs at the Light and Land course I attended in the Hebrides in Scotland. Combined with seeing the LF cameras in real world use and starting to understand the benefits in composition, I realised this was a path I was inevitably going to travel. So, now I had to explain this to my wife. Fortunately she is long suffering but very understanding and so the green light was given. <br /><br />At this point I had to decide what Camera and lenses I was going to buy. I'll leave this for the next post.

This may end up in a 'history' article at some point.<br /><br />When I bought my first camera (Apart from the Zenith E I had when I was 14), I wasn't particularly savvy about lenses or cameras and so made a few choices based on review sites that weren't particularly accurate. The Canon 20D was a good choice but out of the Canon 70-300DO, 17-85 and 10-22, only the 10-22 was particularly satisfactory.<br /><br />The 17-85 was a pain, showing large amounts of chromatic aberration and also very significant sensor bloom (see attached pictures). The CA can be fixed in photoshop but the purply blue sensor bloom added horrible color casts to any fine detail, high contrast areas (tree branches are a good example).<br /><br />The 70-300 was a great lens most of the time but suffered from low contrast in the details, particularly annoying for grass/plants. It also was very sensitive to veiling flare. <br /><br />The 10-22 however was great. A beautiful lens that only suffered from a little exessive radial blurring in the corners and a strangle colour cast (the cast was subtle and not noticeable unless compared directly to the results from other lenses).<br /><br />The final lenses I bought were the 16-35 and the 50 f1.4. The 16-35 was quite good although smudgy in the corners wide open (see 16-9.net for better reviews). The 50 was loveley with a portrait freindly softness at 1.4 and a little at 1.8. An example of both lenses is given in posts with the relevant keywords. I also bought a manfrotto ball head 486RC2 (which I didn't like, bad QR plate, fiddly and not that strong) and a Velbon sherpa CF631 which I still use. The whole lot went into a mini trekker bag.<br /><br />A couple of months later I sold the 70-300 and 17-85 and bought a Really Right Stuff BH55 ball head and an Epson R2400 printer. The ballhead, along with an L plate, was fantastic and the printer worked a treat, allowing me to create my own prints on the same day as taking photographs. This setup was used for a year during which time I also got a 70-200 f4 and an RSS Omni Pivot package.<br /><br />The next big change was when we got some more space in the attic and I replaced my 20D with a 5D which was an amazing change. At the same time I bought a 35 f1.4, 24TSE and a 100 Macro. I also bought a larger printer, some gear to frame pictures and a proper calibrated screen for my computer (what a difference that made).<br /><br />Most recently, I've finally got a camera rucksack that doesn't wreck my back (Lowepro Pro Trekker II), a laptop that actually works (MacBookPro) and got booked on a Light and Land course in the Hebrides.<br /><br />As I've said, I'll try not to talk technical too much, just enough to explain why I made the choices I have. I'll expand a little on some of the items discussed if they are relevant (like how do you carry a large format camera and a 5D in a Pro Trekker bag) but for the most part I'll try to discuss photography.

I suppose it started before that when I was about 10 and I had a Zenith E for a couple of years but really the interest came about when I bought a Canon 20D with some money I was owed from my company. A week after I bought the camera I went on a holiday in Cornwall and although I didn't take many great pictures, I took a couple that I really liked and that was the hook. Seeing those photographs printed out with my Epson 2400 was immensely satisfying.<br /><br />During August of that year, myself and my wife visited various locations around Yorkshire and I took a handful of good shots (particularly of Brimham Rocks and Malham Cove which I'll post later). Of course, I made a couple of mistakes when I bought the lenses for the camera and sold a few lenses and then sold the camera to get a 5D, which I'll write about later. I also made loads of compositional mistakes and I'll pick a few of those out too.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWteR-QMpI/AAAAAAAAABk/75-kG6Mca-A/s1600-h/mallham-tree-finalbw-3001.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_hAVtpP4knOY/RrWteR-QMpI/AAAAAAAAABk/75-kG6Mca-A/s400/mallham-tree-finalbw-3001.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5095169289171776146" /></a><br />What really motivated me to push photography harder was the total immersive pleasure of being in a beautiful location and trying to portray that feeling through the camera. The process of doing this, whether successful or not, is liberating. It makes you look at things and appreciate things in a way you never would by simply being in a location.<br /><br />I am now on the edge of another step change over to the "Dark Slide", as David Ward would put it,  and I want to document my thoughts, locations, processes etc so this is a start to that process. I'll try to post every other day, which may mean I'll catch up at weekends but we'll see.<br /><br />For the first few months, the posts will be  mix of my thinking on photography, historical entries to catch up with the present day, hardware discussion (a bit) and also my thoughts as I prepare for the world of Large Format Photography.

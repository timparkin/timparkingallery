<dd><p>Personally, I cannot justify the cost of a high-end scanner, like a Flextight, because I just do not shoot anywhere near enough images per year to recoup the capital cost. Equally, I do not have the time to mess about with a drum scanner. <BR/><BR/>I therefore get David at BlueSkyImages to scan my trannies on his Imacon. For £12 per scan, I get a 400MB 16-bit scan that is perfectly colour balanced to the original tranny, scanned exactly to my instructions and meticulously cleaned by hand of all dust. The cleaning alone is worth the cost, because my time can be spent much more profitably doing my "proper job." There are a lot of photographers offering similar services, who generally take a lot more care over their scans than the larger pro or pro-am labs, and I highly recommend this option. <BR/><BR/>As to the quality, I agree that a drum scan is better, in absolute terms. However, in my experience, this is only really visible when viewing at 100% magnification on a computer screen. When it comes to making prints, even large format prints,  I think the difference is barely perceptible and, for me, not worth the significant extra cost of buying a drum scan or the hassle of running one of my own. <BR/>(I should say that my comments apply to 5x4inch film, which has huge reserves of quality in the first place; the situation would no doubt be different for smaller film formats). <BR/><BR/>Others will, of course, have different priorities and opinions, and may simply prefer to make their own scans, rather than rely on a third party. But wouldn't it be boring if we were all the same...</p>

<dd><p>Hi Simon,<BR/><BR/>I hear what you say and have to agree. My desire to get a drum scanner is partly 'geek' value as I like to play with things. If at the same time I get the best scans then that is a bonus. I've spoken with Joe about his Imacon and he agrees with you points but can afford and Imacon (and has one). The amount of scans he has done makes the expense pay off, even at £12 a shot. For myself, I can't imagine scanning four a month at full res but I really want the best results - If I send out, they will cost me £30-£40 a shot for drum scans. Even at £12 a shot, 50 shots a year will cost me nearly £600. If I get my own drum scanner (£1000?) I can get drum scans at £6 a scan over three years. If I'm lucky, I could get a scanner for half of that figure though...</p>

<dd><p>Hi Tim, <BR/><BR/>First, I've enjoyed reading over yr blog.  I too am a LF user and with the poor exchange rate between the $ and Euro you may consider looking at the Tango Drum scans from West Coast Imaging.  For me it is a lot but they are top notch and a 200MB is $40 USD.  <BR/><BR/>Don't know what the shipping would be like but its worth a look.<BR/><BR/>Cheers,<BR/>Mike Watson</p>

<dd><p>The other option is simply to rent time on an Imacon, as and when necessary. Calumet offer this service and I'm sure other places do, too. Given the scanning speed of the high-end machines, you can get through a fair few scans in an hour or so. <BR/><BR/>However, if I was in the market for a high-end machine I'd go for a Creo as these have the dMax to cope with less than optimally exposed transparencies (which I seem to produce far too many of.... :-)), whilst offering the ease of use of an Imacon and the option of wet scanning. Drum scanners are just far too fiddly and unreliable for me to want to go to that sort of effort, I'm afraid.</p>

<dd><p>Hi Mike,<BR/><BR/>I can only seem to find a 100Mb scan for $40 on the West Coast imaging site.. if I want the highest res possible, it looks like I have to pay $275!! At these prices I can pay off my drum scanner (or creo) in two to three months!!<BR/><BR/>Tim</p>

<dd><p>That is if you are scanning at 16 bit.   At 8 bit it is $50 for a 200mb.  <BR/><BR/>Somehow I can't imagine an 800mb scan being terribly useful ;-)<BR/><BR/>How large are you scanning on the epson/howtek/imacon?</p>

<dd><p>Hi Mike,<BR/><BR/>The Howtek max resolution is 4000dpi however the realistic max resolution from 4x5 Velvia is about 3,500 which still equates to a 750Mb file.<BR/> <BR/>The 'standard' medium format film scanner is the Nikon 9000 which scans at 4000dpi - this is the 800Mb equivalent (and the resolution of the scans in the comparison).<BR/><BR/>If I were scanning for archiving (i.e. with the possibility of doing a large fine art print in the future) I wouldn't want to do so below 3000dpi; would probably scan at 4000dpi and then downrez - My thinking being that the only difference is time if you have your own scanner and storage is insignificant compared with effort etc).<BR/><BR/>The 200Mb file you mention would be a 2000dpi file which, whilst fine for most uses, would be missing a bit if you wanted to produce large prints. Of course the chances of needing a  30"x40" file is minimal but if you do, and you want to prnt at epson's print native resolution (360dpi) then you want a 450Mb file ($110).<BR/><BR/>Saying that, if I were paying for scans at the rates that West Coast are charging, 200Mb would probably be the most practical size.. it would make an excellent 20x24 and an acceptable 30x40 (240dpi).<BR/><BR/>I forgot to mention that you don't actually get 4x5" (96mmx120mm) and with clip marks (etc) you only really get 90x110mm so you need 15% extra linear resolution to cope with this loss - so for a 360 dpi print you'd need 2500dpi for a 24x30<BR/> or 3200dpi for a 30x40<BR/><BR/>Bottom line - 2000dpi is fine but I'd scan at 4000dpi if I had a choice. I'd only do this for 3 or 4 a month and then Epson the rest.</p>

<dd><p>I really cannot imagine scanning an image to 750MB and then adding layers in PS.  Do you actually scan your images to this size or is this more theoretical?   <BR/><BR/>I took part in a workshop put on by Charles Cramer, a LF photographer who commonly prints 30x40 on the lightjet and scans at 300mb.  They are exceptional and I doubt very little would be gained by having a larger scan...</p>

<dd><p>Hi Tim,<BR/><BR/>There are a couple of places near me who sell Creos new but to get a test scan I'd have to feign interest in buying one. Could be done, I guess.<BR/><BR/>One of these places regularly offers used high-end scanners and they are currently offering a Topaz and a Purop-Eskofot. The snag is, it's on a buyer-collects basis and as the Topaz weighs around 150Kg and the P-E a whopping 500Kg, I don't think I shall be bothering. Used Creos (a mere 30Kg for an IQSmart) don't seem to be available, sadly. <BR/><BR/>Julian.</p>

<dd><p>Hi Mike,<BR/><BR/>I would down-rez to 3000dpi to work on them but I would still scan at 4000dpi for archiving. Charles obviously feels that scanning at 3000dpi gets as much detail as scanning at 4000dpi and then downrezzing. Once I've learned this myself I might follow suit. As a matter of interest, many large format photographers exhibit pictures from Imacon's which can only scan up to 2040dpi. <BR/><BR/>In reality, most people wouldn't notice if you scanned at 4x5 at 1000dpi, even printed up to 16x20 (I know as I'm exhibiting some prints in town at that resolution). This doesn't mean that for 'self satisfaction' you can't scan at higher resolutions. I, personally, can see information on the film at 4000dpi that is lost scanning at lower resolutions. Hence to archive the film, 4000dpi makes sense (if it doesn't cost any more money). <BR/><BR/>If I were in business, I'd probably be happy using an Imacon 99.9% of people buying pictures would never notice any extra resolution and the time-savings are enormous.</p>

<dd><p>I tend to agree with Simon. Yes I have read and seen lots of scanner tests in the past. Bottom line is that I doubt anyone will be able to detect differences in the print, even at largest sizes and that in general, a photographer's effort is far better expended at the picture taking stage.....<BR/><BR/>The print sniffers (ie they like to get nose grease on the glass of your print invariably without wiping up afterwards- thanks to Matt S for this phrase) struggle to determine. <BR/><BR/>Not long ago I had several arrive at a show and quiz me on scanning and my methodologies. So I was very open and said that some of the prints were scanned on an Epson Perfection 1200 (atrocious by current Epson products) and others on my Flextight, a Precision II - yes I still use it and no, other than convenience of Firewire which is no great deal, I cannot see why I ought to upgrade to a later model). <BR/><BR/>So sniffer No 1 says, 'Which ones are which', I invited them have a good look and then to tell me - they couldn't! Image size was small 26x33cm. <BR/><BR/>IMO, Dmax is far more important for colour pictures than res. That the Flextight 'only' covers 5x4 @ 2040ppi isn't a great issue to me. It is still more than I need for a print from the Epson 7800. <BR/><BR/>Careful attention to dust removal, sharpening, colour adjustment and monitor/printer calibration will yield great prints.<BR/><BR/>So the question/dilemma rests with us as individual photographers, how much time, effort and money do I want to expend in order to feel that I have done my best for my image in the very strong likelihood that no-one will ever notice?<BR/><BR/>I am not advocating sloppiness, just trying to add some realism with a view to liberating some precious time/money to being able to go and make our next images even better.....</p>

<dd><p>Hi Bax,<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the response which I can agree with in some ways but in others I have to (being argumentative) counter with another comment.. <BR/><BR/>You mention that most people can't tell the difference between an old Epson and an Imacon and yet you use an Imacon; this tends to suggest that it's the Imacon was a waste of money (which I know it wasn't).. Also, you mention that spending a lot of time/money on small incremental improvements is a venture of diminishing returns but from someone who spends more time testing raw converters out of anyone I know... <BR/><BR/>Now I don't think this is a bad thing.. What I think it makes a good point about is that we all see different aspects of our own work in different lights.. The improvement from ACR to Capture One would be invisible to most eyes and yet because you can see the difference, it becomes important for you to address this. In my eyes, the halation and colouring of edges is something that really 'gets my goat' and hence I'm interested in working a way around this.. <BR/><BR/>Also, we're all taking different amounts and types of photographs. I only want ten good photographs out of a year of photography so am willing to spend more time on each photograph. <BR/><BR/>Joe and yourself might need/want to take 20-30 good pictures per month and hence need to have a streamlined, per-image workflow in order to get back out taking photographs. <BR/><BR/>it's all a long winded way of saying 'horses for courses' ;-)</p>

<div id="cpost-body" style="display:none;"><div class="post"><div class="post-body">[Photo]<br><br>I&#39;ve posted previously about a comparison between drum scanners and Epson flatbeds. The fact that the drum scanner trounced the Epson was not really in contention but recently I had the opportunity to get a scan from a modern Imacon scanner (owned by Joe Cornish) and from a Howtek 4000 drum scanner (re-badged Crosfield Magnascan 200i I believe, and owned by Dav Thomas) using Silverfast Ai v 6.6 &amp; Kami SXL 2001 fluid both using the same transparency that I had previously had problems with using my Epson. <br><br>I knew that the drum scanner was going to provide a better resolution scan than the Imacon but I was more interested in how well it scanned shadows and was it immune to some of the artefacts that I'd seen from the Imacon and the Epson. These artefacts were halation and chromatic abberation. <br><br>Halation, a glow around high brightness areas that impinges into darker areas. I have seen a small version of this, a few pixels on a 2000dpi scan, and also a larger version that spreads 2-300 pixels. In photographic terms this is similar to flare and I imagine it occurs in a similar fashion.

In the scan you can see this the worst around the white lichen hot spots at the bottom left of the picture but it can also be seen at the top right of the cliff top and also as a strange colouring in the sea where you have a highlight off the wave top right next to a shadow from that same wave.

However, there are many other factors at play here. Wet scanning is messy and a lot of people are uncomfortable exposing transparencies in this way. Also, the whole process is a lot more time consuming. Finally, the amount of room a drum scanner takes up can be 10x as much as an Imacon. Realistically, if you want to scan more than a couple of photos a month and you have the budget, an Imacon will always be a better choice. However, for those with limited budgets, excess time and who only process a few images a month, a drum scanner will produce stunning results.</div>

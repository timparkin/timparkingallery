<dd><p>Very interesting post, thanks. Would you say the betterscanning holder is definitely worth it to extract that bit more out of the V750? Also what type of tape do you use to hold the neg in place?</p>

<dd><p>Hi Tristan,<BR/><BR/>Personally I would say not.. I would however try to 'shim' the standard holder to try to find the best focus point. I'm sure you can get a slightly better result by using the betterscanning holder but the difference will be hardly visible. I've yet to try wet mounting but if I were happy to go to that much trouble, I would buy a second hand drum scanner (a colleague has wet mounted and is unsure of the benefits).</p>

<dd><p>Hi Tim. I have the same scanner and been reasonably happy with the results. One thing that helped with colour accuracy was using Velvia 50 and Provia 100F profile targets from Wolf Faust (googleable). <BR/><BR/>On a separate scanning issue - do you do any other processing in Silverfast (brightness, contrast etc.) or do you leave it all until PS?<BR/><BR/>Cheers.<BR/><BR/>Paul</p>

<dd><p>Hi Paul!<BR/><BR/>I'm using a target (it's only the Monaco one though) and I'm happy with the general colour, it's the colours in shadow detail and the drift in colour as you approach highlights that is annoying. In the imacon vs epson example, the sky is consistent colour on the imacon but the epson tends to yellow in the highlights. In the shadows the epson loses saturation rapidly compared with the Imacon. I don't tend to do any processing in Silverfast at all, I try to get as close to a raw scan as possible (no sharpening, no exposure etc). I figure I spent a lot more on photoshop than on silverfast :-)</p>

<dd><p>Interesting findings Tim, having read your blog I found myself going back to my scanning and conducting my own tests again – what a riveting way to spend a couple of hours. I tried scanning at 2,400 and 1,600 dry and oil mounting and doing various passes in Silverfast. I think, after all that, your optimum resolution of 1,600 is about right.<BR/><BR/>The technique I'm settled on before was to scan at 2,400, do an sharpen is PS and then downsample to something like 1,800. I did some comparisons using this technique and a scan at 1,600 and I must say the results were very similar. Comparing the oil mounted scans to the dry scans I can detect a slight bit of extra detail in the oil scans but I'd say it's not worth the extra hassle. I'm pretty sure I couldn't tell the difference in a final print from my Epson R2400. I think the reason for this is that the Betterscan holder, when carefully set up extracts about all the information it is capable of out of what is in the end, a pretty cheap scanner. I'd disagree slightly about the Betterscan being worth getting, I think it's a great piece of kit and the anti-newton glass is great to use.<BR/><BR/>From the comparisons with the Imacon, I'd certainly wouldn't say there's £11,500 worth of difference, it would be interesting to see a comparison with a true drum scanner which whould be better than the Imacon.<BR/><BR/>Something you haven't mentioned is the multi-pass option in Silverfast and the (rather rubbish sounding) 48bit HDR option. I find that for certain, more difficult scans, this option works better than scanning in straight 48 bit mode. I use the HDR setting with 2 or 4 passes, this works particularly well with negatives. The multi-pass option certainly helps remove digital noise in the shadows.<BR/><BR/>I'm about to get some of my trannies and negs drum scanned so it'll be interesting to see how special they look in comparison!<BR/><BR/>Cheers<BR/>Dav</p>

<dd><p>Hi Dav!<BR/><BR/>Sorry for making you go through the testing grinder - good to have confirmation on stuff though.. I'll be really interested in seeing the drum scan differences, could you let me see some samples once done. If I could, I'd like to post them on the blog too..<BR/><BR/>I tried the multi-pass stuff in Silverfast but got heavy banding in the shadows and lost fine detail. I shall have to try this again though as I have some particularly dense trannies..<BR/><BR/>I may reassess the bettermount opinion. I certainly wouldn't want to be rid of mine so I think it may be worth it if you really, really need the extra detail..<BR/><BR/>Could you send me a 100% sample of fluid mount vs non fluid mount too? I'd be interested in seeing this difference.</p>

<dd><p>Hello folks,<BR/><BR/>I admit to not being an LF user - 35mm and MF for me at the moment. I have been getting rather soft scans from most 35mm slides (in very thin mounts from the lab). Strangely some MF scans are softish, others are very good indeed. I have seen the review at http://www.photo-i.co.uk/ and have tried the 3.5mm spacers but I am not convinced that the results are any better.<BR/><BR/>Has anybody got any good ideas for me to try? The betterscannig holder seems a bit pricey in comparison to the scanner itself especially if it doesn't really help. Maybe it's better to simply scan at the lower res?<BR/><BR/>Rgds., Adam</p>

<dd><p>Hi Adam, <BR/><BR/>My only advice is to try scanning at 48bit, 1600dpi and no sharpening.. Then get a demo copy of Photokit sharpener and use the capture sharpener for your film type. This is about as sharp as it gets. As a guide though, I get more detail in my scans than I can see with a 10x Schneider loupe. Pity we didn't get to chat more at Oban, hopefully we'll bump into each other again soon. I'm just on my way back from Joe's Hoopers Gallery exhibition (which was really good!) and am sooo tired..  I'll blog about it soon.. <BR/><BR/>Tim</p>

<dd><p>@tristan - sorry I didn't see gthe comment about the tape.. At the moment I'm using 3M sellotape which leaves some residue behind so am looking for a replacement. I'm only securing it about 1mm from the edge anyway so no problem. I'm cleaning the neg with kami fluid and wipes first which minimises static and gets rid of most of the big bogies :-)</p>

<dd><p>To add to the sticking down debate – I use Magic Tape for dry scans and Kami Tape for oil scans (you can get the tape and other oil mounting stuff from: www.haynes-graphic-arts.co.uk). Neither leave much in the way of much on the glass so don'y take a lot of cleaning up.<BR/><BR/>I was having a job getting my glass clean using stuff like Pec-12 and then tried Mr Muscle glass cleaner – seems to work much better - sometimes the simple answers are best!</p>

<dd><p>Hi Tim. I received my Betterscanning mount yesterday and spent a joyful (!!) few hours calibrating it. I dry-mounted the tranny and I can see a clear difference compared to the scans using the Epson holder, which seems to be  due to getting the calibrated height right - approx 3mm.  Cheers. Paul</p>

<dd><p>Hi Paul! <BR/><BR/>Good to see it's making a difference. My height appears to be 3mm as well - I thought the Epson holder was supposed to be 3mm but I think it sags a bit in the holder (probably half a mm or so). <BR/><BR/>I don't bother wet mounting and always scan at 1600 dpi - This is by far and away the best resolution to scan at for the v750 (although you can sacrifice some resolution for dmax if you wish by multi pass scanning).<BR/><BR/>Look forward to seeing some results :-D</p>

<dd><p>Hi Tim - I've just measured the height of the Epson OEM holder and you're right it looks about 3mm, with the alternative setting at about 4mm, (as accurately as I can measure it). Leaves me wondering why there is such an improvement with the Betterscanning holder when it bascially at the same height - maybe you're right, and a few tenths of a mm sag makes a noticeable difference.</p>

<div id="cpost-body" style="display:none;"><div class="post"><div class="post-body">[Photo]<br>[Photo]<br><br>The picture above is the last version of my Easdale picture I took on the first week I had my large format camera and one of my favourites from the recent Gower trip. The reason I'm showing both old and new now is that I've only just got around to scanning all of my images and here's why...<br><br>So, straight after my trip to the Gower, I decided I couldn't wait any longer to get my own scans and after a lot of research, splashed out on an Epson v750. The alternative was to pay a little extra for a second hand drum scanner but the deciding factor was that for the majority of scanning I want to do, I don't need the extra resolution and DMax of the drum scanner and I definitely can do without the extra time taken to drum mount etc. So the answer was a domestic flat bed for the majority of my scanning with the possible option of buying a second hand Howtek, Creo/Eversmart or ICG later.<br><br>First of all, I needed to work out how best to get good detail out of the v750 which means ... Testing!.. <br><br>Well the first thing that needed testing was the optimum height at which to scan. The v750 is factory configured to about 3mm height above the glass but supposedly the actual focus point can be +/- 1 in some instances. I bought a betterscanning newton glass mount which allows you to tape a transparency to the underside of it and ensure a consistent scan height. I scanned up and down in 0.2mm increments and found my perfect height was 3.2mm. The actual resolution difference wasn't a great deal, possibly an extra 100-200 dpi.. <br><br>Once this was complete, I tried scanning at different dpi to find out where the 'break point' was i.e. the point where extra dpi on the slider doesn't result in any increase in effective resolution. I tried quite a few resolutions and did see a jump around the 1600-2400 mark. If we say that the maximum resolution is typically a multiple of the native resolution, then the frankly ludicrous 28800 dpi should scale down to either 3200 or 1600. I tried scans at 1600, 2400 and 3200 and tried scaling the smaller ones up and could not tell a huge amount of difference. In fact, in some cases I saw more resolution out of the 1600 than the 2400.. I thought this was an anomoly but tried a few more times and it seems like the the 2400 and 3200 does some form of interpolation or double passing which smears fine detail. The 1600 dpi scan definitely holds a little more detail although it is undoubtedly slightly noisier. That said, if I reduce the noise with a good filtering program, the results are no worse than the 2400, 3200 scan. <br><br>I also tried the double pass scanning which also smeared resolution and produced some strange patterning in the shadow detail. <br><br>My final test was to see if 48 bit scanning made any difference and to my surprise it definitely did. The results were slightly sharper and less noisy so it appears that something wierd is going on in the downsampling algorithm in Silverfast. <br><br>Anyway, by my real world tests, the best resolution to scan on ther v750 is 1600 dpi with no sharpening and at 48 bit.<br><br>The output scans can take a reasonable amount of sharpening too and I always apply photokit capture sharpener which has a special setting for 4x5 transparencies. This just brings the sharpness up and avoids most haloing - but look out for sharp, high contrast edges where you can use expert capture sharpener and erase the sharpening on them.<br><br>To give you an idea of the results I asked Joe Cornish to scan a transparency that I was working on using his Imacon and the results from the Epson were acceptable alongside it but with some reasonably large problems. <br><br>[Photo]<br>[Photo]<br>[Photo]<br><br>The images to the right and at the bottom are the Epson versions.. The major issues are a lack of colour fidelity, colour problems in the shadows and haloing around high contrast edges. All of these things are hardly noticeable until pointed out or shown side by side. I'm happy with the compromise at the moment and will still be saving up for a drum scanner at some point to make the most out of my 'best' transparencies..<br><br>I should also add that I can get more detail out with the v750 than I can see with a Schneider 10x loupe.<br><br>Addendum :<br><br>I've taken slices from the Rannoch moor photograph and uploaded them to Flickr. I've uploaded two photographs, one sharpened with Photokit Sharpener and one not. The order of the slices are shown is .. <br><br>1) 1600 dpi - but I've tweaked the alignment of the red and blue layers to get rid of chromatic abberation<br>2) 1600 dpi - straight out of scanner<br>3) 1800 dpi<br>4) 2400 dpi<br>5) 3200 dpi<br><br>The CA fix works quite well in getting rid of the red and blue smearing around highlights.. I'm going to have to play more with this. I've also been chatting with Julian Barkway who confirms my visual inspection that the 1600dpi scans are definitely sharper.<br><br>http://www.flickr.com/photos/timparkin/2525239268 - unsharpened<br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timparkin/2524416493">http://www.flickr.com/photos/timparkin/2524416493</a> - sharpened<br><br>Click on All sizes at the top of the photo and then click on the 'original' to see the full size 100% scan.<br><br>I've also figured out a little more about the haloing that occurs, especially the large scale haloing as seen on the Gower worms head shot (at the top of the island). This appears to be caused by the direction of scan. Because the light spans the whole width of the scanner, when scanning a pixel in the middle of the picture, light from either side of the scanner will be causing flare in the lens which will cause a smearing across the picture. I tried changing the direction of the mount and lo and behold the smearing moved to either side of the island (in this case that was more acceptable).</div>

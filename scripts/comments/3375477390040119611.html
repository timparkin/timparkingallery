<dd><p>Hello Tim,<BR/>You must have a lot of spare time to be able to give such a long and considered answer! Anyway, thank you for being constructive. I don't have the time for a long response of my own, so I'll just give a couple ideas. <BR/>1) I like your recipe metaphor. How many ways are there of cooking a potato (or any other ingredient)? When faced with a particular object to shoot (Durdle Door, Eiffel Tower, Rannoch moor, rock textures...), there are only so many approaches. I personally find that the purpose of the result will further limit the options, more or less forcing me to a choice. If it is for one’s own consumption, one may like enough salt to keep a horse happy; if it is for family, one’ll have another approach; if it is for a banquet, yet another. There is no Right choice.<BR/>2) Looking at the two Rannoch moor pics, I certainly would have felt that you were following in DW’s tripod holes. One-upmanship? Plagiarism? Coincidence? Who knows? (Thanks for the clarification)<BR/>3) Yes there is a tendency on the viewer’s part to categorise – that is what gestalt is about. But I also think that the photographers you mention are looking for what can make them stand out from the crowd. So they will prone a particular style. But do they cultivate that style? Having looked at DW’s site (his old one – I couldn’t find a new one: do you know when it’ll be coming out?), there are actually very few no-horizon pics; yet these are clearly what he promotes in his Landscape Within book. “Do as I say, not as I do”: one wonders…? Or has the readership latched on to a small but original idea which chimes with their need to be original, and run with it?<BR/>4) You should ask DW which of those Whitby pics he thinks are Ward-ish or Parkin-ish. The answer could be enlightening. I suspect that there are a million small choices that make your pics Parkin-ish and his Ward-ish, but that these are not obvious to the general viewer unfamiliar with the intricacies of your respective bodies of work, or indeed LF work. A further question might be: when does a deliberate distancing and honing of one’s style become a gimmick? Or a caricature, or a pastiche, or a cliché.<BR/>I’ll write more later if I think of anything else.<BR/>Charles</p>

<dd><p>Hi Charles! <BR/><BR/>I don't drink, smoke, watch TV, etc. It's amazing how much time you have if you make every second count (I'm not brilliant at that but I try).<BR/><BR/>However your question fits in with a subject I think about quite a bit - why do we do what we do? Does it matter if we create pictures the same as other people? Is originality a quest of it's own? (personally I'd say no. The contemporary art world has ended up with some incredible crap with people looking at originality only). <BR/><BR/>I know what you mean about feeling like an environment forces you into a choice but I'd say fight against that - even if the obvious choice is the best, get into the habit of rejecting it and looking at all of the other ways - this is how I  try to learn to see properly. Admittedly I'll end up with the original choice though :-)<BR/><BR/>David and my pictures are very similar but if you search around on the web for "rannoch tree" you'll see a few similar shots. The framing of the mountains, the rocks, etc all suggest one good view - David used a wide lens to get a bigger sky, I didn't have a sky so I went tight in.<BR/><BR/>David's new website is hopefully up in the next few weeks (not much left to do on it) There are more anti-horizon shots in their but it's definitely not a rule he has.<BR/><BR/>I'll ask David to his opinion if possible. Should be interesting. I don't think I've done enough work to have developed a style yet though and definitely not one  you can recognise looking at my pictures to date. My most recent Whitby pictures get closer to it in my opinion..</p>

<div id="cpost-body" style="display:none;"><div class="post"><div class="post-body">[Photo]<br>[Photo]<br>In a comment in a previous post, an interesting point was raised about the influences a photographer brings to bear on their subjects and how to create a style that transcends these influences. <br><br>Charles mentions the Whitby shot three posts previous to this and suggests that it is David Ward-ish and also asks the corollary of this which is, is it Tim Parkin-ish. <br><br>First of all I'm very happy to have my photography compared to David, he is someone whose photography I find inspiring, interesting and rewarding. I've also been developing David's website and so have been working closely with his images for some time. I imagine this can't help but have an influence, even sub-consciously. An example  of this influence would be the photograph of the dead tree on Rannoch Moor that I've recently uploaded to Flickr. <br><br>This photograph was taken without once thinking about David's own iconic picture (which I believe will grace the front of his new book) and it's also not a patch on David's picture (the snow on the mountains, the beautiful fluffy clouds, the strong leading line through use of wide angle). In this location however, I believe there are only a few different obvious and strong 'vista' shots. The location of the stream and the fact that the background is strongest in this direction plus the boulders and plants, both adding detail and colour. Finally, the views in the other directions just aren't as interesting. The main thing I don't like about David's shot is the blocky scan of it I've seen (the amazon cover doesn't look much better at the minute).<br><br>Then again this isn't a particularly David Ward picture in my opinion. The picture that Charles mentions is a lot more reminiscent of the types of picture that I identify David with. It has strong graphic lines and shapes, it makes good use of texture, it 'connotes more than it denotes' (in this case I'd hope to say something about flow and time). But, again, I wasn't thinking about David Ward when I was taking this. If anything, I was thinking about Nigel Halliwell and Mel Foster, both of whom who know David and are probably inspired by him. Does this mean I'm inspired y David second hand in this case.<br><br>But what about the photographers who inspired David? Do David's pictures look David Ward-ish or is there some photographer out there with whom David has a strong link. People talk about a "Joe Cornish" look but they fail to see through Joe through to his influences (Peter Dombrovskis, Eliot Porter, Michael Fatali). <br><br>I believe we have in britain a zeitgeist embodied by certain high profile photographers. This has led to an easy (and lazy) categorisation of anything without a horizon as being Ward-ish, anything rustic (and square) as being Waite-ish, anything Vista-ish with strong near-far compositions as being Cornish-ish. <br><br>It is difficult as there aren't many books tracing the history of Landscape photography through it's influences and people like Eliot Porter get missed completely by a lot of people (my included). <br><br>In hindsight, we can see a photographers body of work and understand a 'style' as being implicit in everything they did. But if you ask that photographer about their artwork, they will show you picture after picture that denies that style; pictures that demonstrate a talent far away from the charicature developed in the media. <br><br>Now how difficult is it for me to have a developed style and to demonstrate it in a single picture. <br><br>I ask you to look at the following pictures and tell me if they fit their photographers charicature..<br><br>[Photo]<br>[Photo]<br>[Photo]<br><br>You can identify the original photographer by their aspect ratio if you like - does this mean that these photographers style's are so closely linked with something as trivial as picture shape?<br><br>Because I've realised that the only way to really let my style show through is to work on a limited body of subject matter until I've exhausted sub-conscious influence and have to start thinking myself about composition, style, topic, etc. In other words, entering a gestalt state of perception and then working back to my visual metaphors (probably having to create them on the way back).<br><br>Charles also asks a few other questions:-<br><br>Do you feel it is your duty or plainly unavoidable to make pictures that someone else (eg David Ward) might have made? <br><br>It's totally unavoidable that I might make pictures that someone else might have made.  It's less likely that this will happen if I have built my own 'recipe' for a photograph to taste nice to me. This recipe might well contain ingredients from other photographers (who may have inherited these ingredients from still other photographers. Some ingredients I will find myself along the way. <br><br>I wonder if David Ward worried about this photograph being 'Sugimoto-ish' (or even 'Gustav Le Gray-ish')<br><br>[Photo]<br><br>Charles also asks a few final questions: -<br><br>Do you feel that your originality lies in the fact that you are the one who has found this material? In other words, do you think that the location will give greater originality than the rendition? <br><br>No but I do believe that working around an original location will more likely allow you to express what your style is rather than being pushed around by the weight of previous photographic incarnations (e.g. I've been to Lochan N-Ha'Achlaise three times but each time I've tried to avoid the cliche compositions). Then again, you could say that if you go to a famous place, you really have to use your own skill and style to create a picture that avoids saying what has already been said... I'm not averse to the rare or popular location as long as it has material that will allow me to be creative in.<br><br>Do you feel that the aim of your quest is to find the material that will allow you to express a particular style, or do you feel that the aim of your quest is to find the material that chimes with something inside you and then to represent it according to a style which suits it and your feelings towards it (a style which you effectively pull out of a catalogue)?<br><br>The aim of my quest is to create a consistent body of work rather than a 'grab bag' of opportunistic photographs. I don't want to collect pictures of famous locations (which seems to be a common photography hobby). It's great to go to a location that you've seen in print and it's exciting if you can create something original from this. It's also great to strike off on your own to find new grounds. I'm going on a Light and Land trip to the Gower peninsula soon at which we'll visit very commonly photographed locations and I'm sure I'll capture shots that are very reminiscent of other photographers. I also hope I'll capture some pictures that present my transcription of those locales..</div>

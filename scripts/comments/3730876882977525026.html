<dd><p>Hi Tim<BR/>I too find limestone pavement areas a bit difficult to compose. They are all over the place and finding good strong shapes is difficult especially when you want a vista… I think you need to get some contrasting elements into the shot…the clichéd hawthorn is never far away (o:<BR/><BR/>You have done a good job in capturing the atmosphere in the location and the conditions look very good but I wonder if you would miss the light in the rapidly changing conditions by running back to get the large format camera. It seems to me that I continually am in a rush to capture what I see before it disappears but that probably says more about the subject I choose and style I favour…btw, Charlotte deserves a medal…I wish Cathy would take some notes from her..

<dd><p>Hi Tim,<BR/><BR/>I wonder if you're not out-thinking yourself here. I try to take David's advice and not go looking for a composition. Instead, I try to let the compositions find me. That way, I find it much easier to adapt my shooting-style and expectations to the prevailing conditions. Admittedly, sometimes I do as you do and scout with my compact, freely shooting anything and everything and then choose my favourites before a follow-up with the big artillery, but that isn't really my preferred MO. <BR/><BR/>A lot of the time, though, I just use my eyes. I don't really consider focal length (apart from in the vaguest of terms) or any other technical aspects, just composition. Occasionally, I'll pull out my framing card to get a better idea if something seems a bit borderline. I find that this approach does not limit my view in the way that looking through a viewfinder would and I am free to build compositions in my head, without the limiting view of an imposed rectangle. Remember, once you put your camera to your eye, you are automatically rejecting many other viable possibilities.<BR/><BR/>Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is I find it best, when looking for compositions, to use the most direct (i.e. simple) approach and not let technology interfere with the least mechanical aspect of the whole photographic process. <BR/><BR/>I wonder if you would find this similarly liberating? Just a random thought to add to the mix.</p>

<dd><p>I've never been to the Dales, but your experiences up there remind me of walking the South Downs for hours on end looking for compositional elements and not being able to see. I suppose one way of looking at it is to tune in to the place and get the feeling of the atmosphere. I find hidden subject matter can jump out at you sometimes if you're in the right head space.<BR/><BR/>I think you've done a great job of achiveing a scense of place with you're photo's here, the thistle one has smashing composition and depth.</p>

<dd><p>@Jason<BR/><BR/>I know what you mean about missing the light, however if the light looks like it won't last I just take a quick picture with my 5D. If the light looks good for some time or is likely to come back then it's out with the big guns. I'm beginning to like the combination of the two cameras and will probably stick with carrying both of them (even though my back will complain). Oh.. and yes Charlotte is an absolute superstar - I couldn't do what I do without her support.<BR/><BR/>@Julian<BR/><BR/>You are probably right Julian and sometimes the compositions just scream at me. When they don't though, it's out with the SLR and hard work time. Strangely I also carry around a compact and a framing card - I think I need therapy.. Perhaps once I've learnt how to see a bit more I'll feel more confident in only taking the LF.. maybe not though.<BR/><BR/>Interestingly, I submitted some pictures to Take a View and none of my large format pictures got through to the finals but some of my 5D ones did. The ones that did couldn't have been taken with the LF camera. <BR/><BR/>@Sean<BR/><BR/>Yes you are right, repeated exposure and also staying in one location for a long period of time does get you past looking for the bug compositions. I think the most rewarding pictures are the ones that you look hardest for (or spend the most time becoming Zen like over).</p>

<dd><p>Hi Tim,<BR/><BR/>I had a wander around some limestone pavement recently for the first time in what seemed like ages. I spent a while pottering around in several areas and found a few places I'd like to revisit. In fact the best place I came across had a boulder which I've seen you photograph earlier in your blog, above Twistleton way. I've often walked the dales but had never come across that one before.<BR/><BR/>Still, even with such a strong shape, I didn't really find any shots I was completely happy with although as the afternoon turned to evening the longer shadows helped to give some much needed definition to the clints and grykes.</p>

<dd><p>Hi Jason, Yes I got three through which I was quite happy with apart from there were no LF - Does this mean I've been getting worse since I've had the new camera? :-)<BR/><BR/>The shots are better processed versions of <BR/><BR/>http://www.flickr.com/photos/timparkin/sets/72157606349185992/</p>

<dd><p>Hi<BR/><BR/>since you're carrying an LF camera, why drag along a DSLR? Perhaps a good compact and some stitching would do? I'm fairly pleased with my ancient coolpix 5000, when using NEF files and making a 2 or 3 shot pano it works out pretty reasonable.<BR/><BR/>Alternatively the Tokina 12-24 I'm using on my 10D is not bad either.<BR/><BR/>Keep up the good work</p>

<div id="cpost-body" style="display:none;"><div class="post"><div class="post-body">[Photo]<br><br>I've just come back from a quick outing to the Dales and although I really enjoyed it immensely, I kept on asking myself "What to shoot?". It wasn't that there was a lack of subject matter; The place we went to, Warrendale Knotts, was extraordinary and put Malham to shame in some ways but there didn't seem to be an 'idea' out there... <br><br>The three photographs I came away with (first one with the Ebony but not developed yet) were OK and portrayed what was around me but they didn't have a visual story (for want of a better phrase) to lead me into the picture. I started to think why I thought like this, why did I think something was missing.<br><br>The only thing I can think of is that I didn't see either a strong actual subject or a strong compositional subject. These two things are what excite me when I find them in the field. The actual subject would be something like a tree or an erratic boulder or a waterfall, etc. The compositional subject would be a strong suggested shape or interlocking of shapes or a pattern that repeats in a geometric fashion. My favourite photographs combine these two things together, for instance my recent shot of the English Stonecrop where the composition shape was a flow across the frame and back, using a visual metaphor for a waterfall. <br><br>[Photo]<br><br>With the location I was in at the weekend, there was no actual subjects that were enough of a focal point to support a picture on its own. The rocks formations were nice but there wasn't a main attraction and a supporting cast (e.g. Old Man of Storr or the Quiraing) so the strength of the actual subject wasn't that great. It was also difficult to combine the elements into a strong geometric/compositional arrangement. This left me with trying to balance weak subject matter with subtle arrangement to create a coherent whole. Now I know this can be done as Christopher Burkett and Eliot Porter or masters at this, but I have difficulty visualising these types of composition in the field. <br><br>At the moment I'm using my 5D as a finder still and walking all around an area (in this case the crags that appear in all three shots) trying to find suitable arrangements. I'll then take my compact flash back to Charlotte (who has either fallen asleep at this stage or is happily reading a book) and look through the pictures to choose a 'best'. So in this case I chose the second picture as the one I would take with the large format camera. <br><br>When I returned, however, I thought that the second picture here is probably the better composition. I didn't think it would work as well whilst looking through the finder because of the scree in the left hand corner of the picture. Now I'm not so sure, I quite like the 'more complete' view but feel the first picture has more compositional interest .  feedback welcome!. <br><br>[Photo]<br><br>And finally, just to take up a point that David mentioned in his recent heretical support of the digital phone camera, I took this shot whilst walking back where the light literally appeared out of nowhere and was gone in a minute. The picture isn't great (Thistles are difficult plant in many ways) but it was visual feast at the time. <br><br>I'm trying my best to work out 'field tactics' for finding compositions and the main thing at the moment appears to be about finding a base camp and then scouting around with just my SLR, feeling free to photograph those things that interest me. This does mean carrying around far too much gear though, perhaps once I get a mini GND kit for my Ricoh I'll try to sacrifice the 5D.. The problem I have with the Ricoh though is that using the zoom becomes too much of a concious decision. With the 5D, I look through the viewfinder (I've cropped it to 4x5 btw) and with my right hand on the zoom , I can wander around a composition whilst dynamically changing the focal length, playing with perspective as part of my experimenting. With the Ricoh, the feedback loop between thinking about zooming in and it actually happening is just too slow to stay in the sub-concious. <br><br>I have looked around for 1.6 crop factor SLR/Lens combination that would be a lot lighter than the 5D but there aren't many lenses that do the same as the 24-105 (I'd need a 16-65 lens at least.. preferably a 12-80 to get a decent range..).<br><br>Actualy I've just this second had a browse around and discovered what may be the perfect compromise.. Sony have a 16-105 lens for their 1.5 crop factor cameras. This is 96-630mm equiv in large format terms.. Hmmm... more thinking needed.</div>
